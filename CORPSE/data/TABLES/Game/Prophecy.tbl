Where {Title}s encounter {TitleBad}s, {EvocativeConcept} follows.
Once the {TraitBad} {TitleBad} rises, the only hope lies with the {Site} of {EvocativeConcept}.
The Golden Age begins once the {TraitGood} {Title} reclaims the {Made_Of:Hard} {Weapon}.
Within the {Made_Of} {Site} lies {EvocativeConcept}.
If it is {EvocativeConcept} you seek, then seek the {TraitBad} {Title}.
{EvocativeConcept} shall be found in {EvocativeConcept}, in the grasp of the {Made_Of} {TitleBad}.
If the {TraitBad} {TitleBad}'s Legions aren't halted, all is lost.
{EvocativeConcept} sits within the chambers of the {TraitGood} {TitleBad}.
A {TraitGood} {TitleBad} shall fall from the heavens to defeat the {Action}ing {Made_Of} {Life}.
Seek the Riddle of {EvocativeConcept} beyond the {Site} of {Made_of}.
The Chosen One shall {Action} with the {TitleBad} of {Made_Of}.
Beware the {Made_Of} {TitleBad} that dwells within the {Trait} {Site}.
The kingdom shall {Action} for {EvocativeConcept}.
The Legendary {Made_Of} Chest of the {TraitBad} {TitleBad} holds naught but {EvocativeConcept}.
{Action}ing with the {TitleBad} is the surest path to {TraitBad} {EvocativeConcept}.
There exists a {Action}ing {Site} where rests the {Made_Of} {Job}.
In the {Site} of {EvocativeConcept}, behind the Door of {Made_Of} hides the {TraitBad} {TitleBad}.
The End of {EvocativeConcept} shall be heralded by the {Action}ing of the {Noise} {TitleBad}.
Not every {TitleReligious} is good, nor is every {TitleBad} evil.
They shall call him both {TraitGood} and {TraitBad} with the same breath.
