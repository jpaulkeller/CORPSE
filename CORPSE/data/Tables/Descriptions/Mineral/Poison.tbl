/ Craft (Poison-making): The fine art of refining raw materials into effective poisons requires both patience 
/ and care (not to mention discretion, in areas where poisons are outlawed). Making poisons with the Craft 
/ (poison-making) skill follows the rules in the Player�s Handbook for all Craft skills, with the following 
/ exceptions.

/ Price: The cost of raw materials varies widely depending on whether the character has access to the active 
/ ingredient�that is, the venom or plant that actually provides the toxin. If a supply is readily available, 
/ the raw materials cost one-sixth of the market price, not one-third. Otherwise, the raw materials cost at 
/ least three-quarters of the market price - assuming the substance in question is for sale at all.

/ Amount: To figure out how much poison you are able to create in a week, make a Craft (poison-making) check
/ at the end of the week. If the check is successful, multiply the check result by the DC for the check. 
/ That result is how many gp worth of poison you created that week. When your total gp created equals or 
/ exceeds the market price of one dose of the poison, that dose is finished. (You may sometimes be able to 
/ create more than one dose in a week, depending on your check result and the market price of the poison.) 
/ If you fail the check by 4 or less, you make no progress that week. If you fail the check by 5 or more, 
/ you ruin half the raw materials and have to buy them again.
