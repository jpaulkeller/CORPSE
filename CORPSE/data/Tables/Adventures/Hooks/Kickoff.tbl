The heroes find themselves returning to consciousness after having been turned to stone for dozens, maybe hundreds of years. They have been kept as statuary in the garden of a lich but an arcane experiment gone bad has unraveled the enchantments and returned the heroes to flesh.
The slave ship transporting the heroes has come under attack near the shores of an uncharted isle. The hull is flooding, the crew is being slaughtered, and the heroes are chained up in a sinking vessel. The heroes need to slip their shackles, escape the ship, and make their way to shore.
The heroes awaken in some sort of temple dedicated to an evil entity. Several dead cultists are nearby drained of life and it is clear that the heroes were all just resurrected from the dead. None of them remember anything of their former lives but a group of zealous crusaders are about to break down the doors to the temple.
While doing time in the city dungeons a fellow inmate is broken out by a group of professionals. Although they are in and out with their target the mayhem they caused has left the heroes with an ideal opportunity to make their escape.
The heroes have insulted important people in power and as punishment they are taken to the edge of the wastelands and exiled for their insolence. They are given only the barest of tools and accessories before being cast out.
The caravan the heroes were part of is attacked while camping overnight. The attackers attempt to take members of the caravan captive but one of the travelers offers the heroes an interesting award to help him escape from the attackers.
The heroes are asked to deliver an important document to a nearby kingdom via a linked teleportation circle. Something goes wrong when the characters teleport and they find themselves in an ancient crumbling ruin in some unknown part of the world.
