Check out the Dresden Files character creation. It's a cool method where each player gets a card and starts writing a story from their character's perspective then everyone passes it to the right. The next person picks up the story from their character's perspective. The Dresden Files' book gives really good prompts and directions too. This is fun because it's something that the players build together and gives them backstories to reference even in the first session of play. It's also super nice because they do most of the work instead of you.
