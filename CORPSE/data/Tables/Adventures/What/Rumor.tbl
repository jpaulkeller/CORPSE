“There’s a wizard or sorcerer or something, he lives in a tower or cave in the marshlands south of the woods. Or maybe further east? Anyway, for the right price, he’ll can actually bring someone back from the dead for you. The price is always pretty steep, I grant you, and it’s never something as mundane as silver or gold, but…What’s that? Of course, it works perfectly – I’ve seen it first-hand! He brought Crazy Tom back to life after the incident with those dog-faced things. You know, back when folks just called him Tom.”
“There are some mushrooms in the ‘Mark with great beneficial properties. The ones with a violet stem and a bright red cap, they let you see in the dark for a time. The yellow ones with green under the cap? They let you understand the speech of any other creatures in the area who’ve eaten them. But whatever you do, don’t eat the white mushrooms with black spots on their caps. Don’t pick them, don’t touch them, just leave them alone. What? No, they aren’t poisonous or psychedelic; just – trust me, don’t do it.”
“The banks of the river at the eastern edge of the plains just outside town? That area’s called Old Rout. No, not ‘route’ with an ‘e’, Rout as in the battle became a rout and most of the army drowned in the fucking river. And that’s why in Old Rout you never want to drink the water or make camp during the full moon.”
“You know that mountain to the north-east you can from the plains on a clear day? It’s an extinct volcano. Dead for eons. I hear there are old lava tunnels honeycombing the whole mountain. Treasure stashed there, too, or so it’s said. Don’t ask me who left it there. Just mind the earthquakes and cave-ins.”
“They say the Six Empires are looking for another route into the ‘Mark, bypassing Vallation. They want all the resources and treasure there, same as us. Gods help us if they decide to start warring over it. They’ll burn it all to cinders, just like they did with the Fae Isles.”
“Yes, there are a few brigands and vagabonds and such to watch out for, but nothing organized. It’s not like there’s a trade road through the ‘Mark, so there aren’t any professional bandits…just a few desperate souls, exiles mostly, living off the land with few scruples about stealing from anyone they encounter. Not all that far removed from the likes of any of us here, if you ask me.”
“Somewhere, way out in the ‘Mark, there’s a place that all the ancient civilizations that rose and fell in the region used to build their cemeteries. We’re talking necropolis built on necropolis built on necropolis, layer after layer after layer. Vast amounts of wealth buried there, from nations long-forgotten…but of course the whole place is overrun with the worst sorts of dead things.”
“No, no, no – what you’re describing isn’t an orc; it’s a Green Tusked Ape. Tons of apes out there in the ‘Mark; white apes with four arms, mandrills that can burst into flames, orangutans , and my brother-in-law says he once saw a winged ape flying overhead. A veritable plethora of primates, yessir. Orcs, now they’re a different thing. Nasty, despicable creatures. Got snouts like pigs or boars.”
“You know those wetlands south of the woods, where that river runs into that deep black lake? There’s a village of these creatures there, and probably other villages throughout the mark, of these creatures called…eh, Swamp Grumps or something like that. Anyway, they’re a deeply religious lot, and they’re always praying to their gods – strange old gods, the kind we should be glad we don’t have to pray to anymore. The kind of gods who are going to end the world someday….according to these Muddy Bumps or whatever they’re called, anyway.”
Person A: “Of course it isn’t flat! Everyone knows that. If it was flat, we wouldn’t have a horizon. No, it’s curved. But that doesn’t mean it’s round like a ball! If it were a ball, you could travel in the same direction for a long, long time, go all the way around the ball, and end up back where you started. Ever heard of someone doing that? No, instead, it’s more like an infinite spiral in all directions through the aether-space. Every direction you go, the world curls in on itself, infinitely. You could walk forever across the world, and still have forever left to go unexplored!”  Person B: “You sure have some odd ideas in that head of yours, Crazy Tom.”

=Rumors (a work in progress!)=

Welcome to the Rumors page! 

GMs can use this page to quickly produce evocative ‘facts’ about their worlds. Written for no particular setting, the goal was only to create, through whispers and oblique suggestions, a world that would be fun to adventure and intrigue in, making it widely applicable to (and hopefully not too generic for) nearly any fantasy environment.

Mythology and the history of antiquity inspired much of the content, with some twists; I steer more towards literary content than game mechanics, but I know as a GM what inspired me most were always simple ideas I could flesh out and run with, so I offer these in that same spirit: may these rumors provide a spark that lets your creativity mold something memorable at the game table.

If you’d like to help this project, check out the 6 main subtables (Dungeon, Local, Prophecy, Strange_Custom, Urban, Wilds) to see how the main content is being generated. Also, Rumors’ “Discussion” page contains some very useful resources that call ALL external and internal subtables, with 3 examples of each, for a quick overview of what a given subtable is doing. Have fun!

1,dwarfs all come from a group of human criminals condemned to work in a gold mine who ended up trapped underground due to an earthquake. After thousands of years of inbreeding and cannibalism, the modern dwarf began to emerge
1,dwarfs are so dumb, their greatest general, Steady Hand McDuff, laid siege to an empty city for over a year
1,dwarfs are so obsessed with justice, their great king Zallen is commended for having tried and hung a mouse for eating one of his subject’s kernels of corn

1,elves are useless; their bones are too brittle to perform any real work without risking injury
1,elves’ longevity comes from bathing in the blood of humans, kept stored in a great well
1,elves are lazy do-nothings, keeping dozens of specialized slaves; one’s entire purpose might be to turn a certain doorknob, while another would open the door; still another would remove a guest’s cloak, while a fourth hangs the cloak
1,female elves must bewitch men in order to get pregnant—all male elves are sterile
1,one should never accept an elf’s dinner invitation: they’ll serve non-elves their own sweet-smelling waste

1,hobbits love one sound above all others: that of others working
1,hobbits never wash their foot hair because they nurture the parasites that grow there
1,pixies and Pyms arise as a result of disgusting unnatural acts hobbits perform with the trees surrounding their homes
1,hobbits steal luck from everyone they encounter, deliberately ruining the fortunes of their neighbors
