dwarfs all come from a group of human criminals condemned to work in a gold mine who ended up trapped underground due to an earthquake. After thousands of years of inbreeding and cannibalism, the modern dwarf began to emerge
dwarfs are so dumb, their greatest general, Steady Hand McDuff, laid siege to an empty city for over a year
dwarfs carve their children out of stone and precious jewels
dwarfs have no souls, so you can do whatever you want to them with no moral repercussions
dwarfs worship a deity best likened to a living slot machine who rewards their greed with increased material returns

;local_racist_elf
Elf-Queen Morganae, whom elves revere as the pinnacle of natural beauty, is really a dog-ugly hag glamoured up with fae charms
elves were only recently ‘uplifted’ by a meddlesome interdimensional imp, who gave them their beautiful cities and culture. Before that, they were primitive ulfs, graceless clods too stupid to even develop a language
elves are useless; their bones are too brittle to perform any real work without risking injury
elves’ longevity comes from bathing in the blood of humans, kept stored in a great well
elves are lazy do-nothings, keeping dozens of specialized slaves; one’s entire purpose might be to turn a certain doorknob, while another would open the door; still another would remove a guest’s cloak, while a fourth hangs the cloak
female elves must bewitch men in order to get pregnant—all male elves are sterile
never accept an elf’s dinner invitation: they’ll serve non-elves their own sweet-smelling waste

hobbit magicians are a joke because the hobbit brain is objectively smaller than the brains of other races
hobbits love one sound above all others: that of others working
hobbits never wash their foot hair because they nurture the parasites that grow there
pixies and Pims arise as a result of disgusting unnatural acts hobbits perform with the trees surrounding their homes
hobbits steal luck from everyone they encounter, deliberately ruining the fortunes of their neighbors
Titchy Gren, the great hobbit burglar who supposedly stole a dragon’s hoard, actually just snuck into the king’s treasury the day of the great castle fire like a common looter

humans would rather climb a mountain for a moment of glory than write a poem that lasts through the ages
