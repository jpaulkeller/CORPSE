Use Lackeys: Villains, as a rule, delegate. Defeating a villain should generally be an end goal of a group of PCs. As a result, they will have minions that will act as both examples of the villain’s power and/or cruelty.
Be Resourceful: A good villain uses their resources to make the PC’s miserable. Sometimes this is powerful Magic, sometimes its cutting edge tech, sometimes its powerful minions. A good villain has seen it all, and while the PC’s situation shouldn’t be unbeatable, a bit of preparation goes a long way.
Have an Escape Plan: A good villain should have some sort of escape plan to survive for another day. Some examples of this are secret passages, getaway vehicle/mount/magic, and “distractions” that the heroes must deal with giving the villain ample time to flee.
Take Hostages: Hostages provide the PC’s with a moral dilemma and gives the villain some wiggle room when dealing with them. Note that the Hostage doesn’t necessarily have to be a living thing... it could be an artifact, or settlement as well.
Fight on the Villain’s Terms: If a villain knows the PCs are coming, they will fight only when they are ready. Even if they don’t know the PCs are coming, a good villain has several tricks due to experiences with pesky adventurers.
Lose Ungracefully: The villain should try to end the encounter in a manner that gets under the player’s skin. Examples are to cause a distraction, sacrifice an underling, take somebody with you, and even go out with a bang.
