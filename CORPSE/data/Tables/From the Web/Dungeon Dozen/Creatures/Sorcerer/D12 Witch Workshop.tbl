Bat winged cloak (non-magical but awesome)
Magical shoes that allow the wearer to surmount and run along moon beams
Twenty foot long python w/black fur and the head of a cat curled up in front of the hearth

Binoculars with large vat-grown eyes instead of lenses: press against forehead to use
Elaborately woven bed crafted of briers and brush covered with wicked thorns
A variety of living brains in ichor-filled ceramic vessels hooked up to Rube Goldberg machine that automatically awakens the witch at sundown and prepares an unmentionable breakfast
