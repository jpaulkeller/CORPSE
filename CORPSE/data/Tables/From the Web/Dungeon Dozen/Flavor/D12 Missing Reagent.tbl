Ectoplasmic residue from a friendly ghost
Essence of solar flare
Cornea of a gorgon
One dozen pixie brains, whole
Flop sweat from the brow of currently reigning monarch
Werewolf vomit
Infected tooth of a giant
Pineal gland of a soothsayer whose uncanny prescience disallows surprise attack of any kind
Vial of tears from an innocent prior to execution
Two Cockatrice egg whites, beaten to stiff peaks
Willingly donated venom from the scorpion queen's stinger
First bud of spring from the uppermost branch of the colossal oak which also happens to house two competing clans of sentient giant wasps
