The Beard of Worms
Stomach rumblings of evil portent
The Hex of Unrelenting Ennui
The Implacable Urge of Self-annihilation
The Evil Third Eye
The Doom of Obscurity
Always followed by rats
Victories shall be hollow
The Unattainable Ambition
The Doom of Repeated Public Humiliations
The Unpredictable Apoplexy
The Repellent Stench Unremovable
