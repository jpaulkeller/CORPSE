The Warrior
The most common sort of Fighting
Man is the Warrior, and this often
becomes the “default” Fighting Man
in campaigns where variants are used.
The Warrior is an expert fighter, a
skilled soldier, a deadly sell-sword.
The Warrior has no ability
prerequisite, though melee fighters
and missile fighters will no doubt
wish to favor the ability that most
affects their chosen specialty.
Prerequisite Ability: None.
Combat Specialty: Warriors may
choose to favor melee combat or
ranged combat. Whichever is
chosen, the Warrior is +1 to-hit and
damage with all weapons of that type.
For example, a Warrior with the
melee Combat Specialty is +1 to-hit
and damage with swords, axes,
maces, etc.
Unstoppable: Any time a Warrior
makes a melee attack against an
enemy that results in dropping that
enemy to 0 or less hit points, the
Warrior gets an immediate attack
against another enemy within range.
Potentially, this could result in the
Warrior killing all enemies within
reach, if they are weak enough to be
killed with one hit! Note that Melee
Combat Specialty is not required for
the use of this special ability.

The Ranger
The Ranger is a variant of Fighting
Man that represents the trackers,
hunters, and wilderness guides of a
campaign. The Ranger is an expert at
surviving in the most difficult of
environments, able to seek out the
water and food necessary to sustain
life far from civilization. The Ranger
is also an expert tracker, and often
serves as a guardian of the fringes of
civilization.
Prerequisite Ability: Wis 13+
Combat Specialty: The Ranger is an
expert at fighting humanoids such as
orcs, goblins, ogres, and the sort. The
Ranger is +1 to-hit and damage
against such foes. This bonus
increases to +2 at 5th level, and again
to +3 at 9th level (maximum bonus).
In more Sword&Sorcery style
campaigns, where humanoids are not
common, the referee may choose to
allow this bonus against foes such as
savages, berserkers, and other human
threats from the wild borderlands of
society.
Tracking: The Ranger can easily
track all but the oldest trail in
wilderness surroundings, and may
even track spoor greater than a week
old (5 in 6, with an additional -1 for
each week beyond the first). In
dungeon or urban conditions, the
Ranger may still track to extent
(typically a 2 in 6 chance, modified
by the referee for circumstances such
as traffic, dirt, etc).
Alertness: The Ranger is stealthier
and harder to surprise than most men,
and his senses are often keener. The
Ranger gains a +1 bonus (on a d6) to
such actions as listening, looking for
pits, sneaking, etc.
18
The Paladin
The Paladin is the epitome of the
Holy Warrior, a man devoted to the
pursuit of goodness, justice, and Law
through the mettle of his character
and the strength of his swordarm.
Most Paladins are members of Holy
Orders devoted to a deity of Law,
though some solitary warriors have
been known to be called to such a life
by their dreams and visions. The
exceptional abilities of the Paladin are
granted solely through the grace of
the powers of Law, and should a
Paladin stray from the righteous path,
all abilities will lost, if not
permanently than until some special
quest or penance is performed.
Prerequisite Ability: Cha 13+
Prerequisite Alignment:
Lawful(good)
Holy Aura: A Paladin is considered
to be, permanently, under the effects
of the spell Protection from Evil.
Anointed Flesh: The Paladin is
immune to Disease, and is allowed a
saving throw against attacks that
would normally drain a level.
Turn Undead: Beginning at 4th level,
a Paladin may Turn Undead exactly
as a Cleric of three levels lower.
The Rogue
The Rogue is an agile and crafty
Fighting Man, a duelist, a thug, a
mountebank, a rake. Equally at home
in the high courts of nobility as he is
in the lowest of gambling dens, the
Rogue lives by his wits, speed, and
flashing blade. A Rogue eschews the
use of heavy armor, and disdains the
use of clumsy large weapons.
Prerequisite Ability: Dex 13+
Armor Restriction: A rogue clad in
any but the lightest armors loses all
other benefits of this Variant.
Alertness: The Rogue is stealthier
and harder to surprise than most men,
and his senses are often keener. The
Ranger gains a +1 bonus (on a d6) to
such actions as listening, looking for
traps, sneaking, etc.
Backstabbing: With surprise, and
armed with a melee weapon, the
Rogue may strike at +4 to-hit for
double the normal damage inflicted.
Unlike with Thieves, this damage
does not increase at higher levels.
Thievery: The Rogue has a base
chance of 20% to pick locks, disarm
small traps such as poisoned needles,
palming small objects, picking
pockets, etc. This chance increases by
5% each level.
19
Weapon Master
The Weapon Master chooses to focus
on a single weapon, devoting most or
all of his training to that particular
armament. The Weapon Master may
be a duelist-for-hire, a master archer,
even a skilled master of siege
weaponry such as the arbalest or
catapult! Through his devotion to his
chosen specialty, the Weapon Master
often unlocks many secrets of combat
lore unavailable to other types of
warriors.
Prerequisite Ability: Int 13+
Combat Specialty: The Weapon
Master may choose a single weapon.
With this weapon, he is +1 to-hit and
+2 to damage. At fifth level, the
bonus increases to +2 to-hit and +3 to
damage, and at 9th level, the bonus
increases to +3 to-hit and +5 to
damage (maximum bonus).
Defensive Technique: Provided the
Weapon Master is armed with his
weapon of choice, and is not equipped
with a shield, the Weapon Master
gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class. If
armed with a magic weapon, the
bonus of that weapon may also be
included, to a maximum total bonus
of +3 to AC.
Attack Speed: At 9th level, the
Weapon Master gains an additional
attack per round with his weapon of
specialty.
Creating your own Variants:
There is certainly room for further
variants to the trusty Fighting Man.
Others I have created include the
Noble, the Archer, and the Merchant,
but I’ve excluded them in the interest
of not wanting to influence your own
creative impulses! It’s important to
remember when creating houserules
for a game like Swords & Wizardry
that you are tampering with a ruleset
an important attraction of which is its
being so “rules-lite”. With that in
mind, I always recommend no more
than 2 or 3 “benefits” to a given
variant, no ability prerequisite greater
than 13, and no restrictions that will
make the variant feel like a
“shoehorn” rather than a desirable
expansion to what is already a great
class!

Healing in a Low-Magic
Campaign.
After a combat, damaged PCs may
spend one turn on "first aid",
healing 1d4hp of damage sustained
in that particular combat. This is
acually an old house rule I first
noticed in the old Judges Guild
"Ready Ref" Sheets, and just this
house rule alone improves play
regardless of genre, as it also frees up
Clerics to exploit a wider variety of
spells. Personally, I find it also better
reflects the nature of hit points
themselves, in that they are a more
abstract form of damage, representing
not just actual wounds, but fatigue,
bruising, and even combat ability. The
left-over damage after the 1d4hp of
first aid represents the actual injuries
that will require rest or more intensive
healing.
PCs regain lost hp at a rate of
1d3hp per day of rest. This is a
healing rule I've adopted from the
Moldvay Basic book, and far
preferable in my opinion to the more
common 1hp/day standard. It's faster
on average, and gives the player's
something to do every day (roll a d3)
rather than just saying "ok, I'm down
6hp, so I rest for 6 days". Also, I
consider "day of rest" to be "day spent
back in town/camp". No one gets any
rest down in the dungeon while
nervously anticipating the next
wandering Umber Hulk encounter.
PCs are welcome to drink, wench,
shop, and divvy treasure while
"healing", provided there is a comfy
bed at the Inn to retire to at a
reasonable hour.
PCs regain lost hp at a rate of 2d3
per day under care of a physician.
Sometimes, PCs don't have all the
time in the world, or are too seriously
injured, to play man-about-town. A
physician does require his patient to
get complete bed rest while under
care, and costs roughly 1gp/hp healed.
Some adventurous physicians can be
lured out on expeditions at a rate of
20-50gp/day (plus cost of poultices
used and the standard 1gp/hp healed
as a "tip"), but will never venture into
actual dungeons, rather remaining at
"base camp". Such field physicians
sometimes also require the aid of one
or more assistants at a rate of 1gp/day.
PCs may be cured of non-magical
diseases and poisons under care of a
physician. Treatment typically takes
3d4 days and costs roughly 50gp/HD
of the creature that inflicted the injury
(for instance, disease from a giant rat
costs about 25gp to cure). Again, this
requires complete bedrest, and a tip of
1gp/hp cured is recommended.
21
Death and Negative Levels:
PCs reduced to 0 or fewer hit points
die in 1d6 rounds. This represents
the time the PC gets for someone to
help stop the bleeding, pull out the
arrow, etc, before actually dying. This
is totally at the referee's discretion, of
course: In cases where the damage
inflicted is catastrophic, such as being
reduced to -30 hp by a blast of dragon
breath, the referee may rule that there
is nothing left to heal! This is another
discovery from those ever-helpful
Ready Ref Sheets.
PCs may regain levels lost as result
of supernatural level-draining
effects under the care of a qualified
physician. Perhaps the most radical
of these houserules, its nonetheless a
good idea to have something like this
in place for any campaign that doesn't
have a high-level cleric in every town.
Regaining lost levels takes 1 week of
complete bedrest for every level lost,
and costs 1000gp per level lost.
Treatment must begin within one
month of the loss, or level loss is
permanent. Only physicians with a
working knowledge of the
supernatural (such as witchcraft,
sorcery, religious mysteries,
herbalism, etc) may render such
treatment.
Non-magical Healing Potions and
Poultices:
Another good way to supplement the
Cleric-free party is to make available
some simple herbal or medicinal
remedies. Some examples might
include:
Poultice of Healing (50gp): This is a
creamy, salve-like poultice that is applied
directly to a wound. It heals 3-6(1d4+2)
points of damage and prevents scarring.
Such a poultice is only effective on an
individual once every 24 hours. A second
application is only half as effective (round
fractions down), and further applications
have no effect whatsoever, until 24 hours
has passed.
Anti-Venom, Weak(25gp): Imbibing
this fluid within one round of poisoning
allows the poisoned victim an immediate
second saving throw against that poison.
Anti-Venom, Strong(200gp):
Imbibing this fluid within one round allows
the victim an immediate saving throw at +4.
Cleansing Remedy(100gp): Imbibing
this foul herbal concoction within 24 hours
of contraction of a disease thoroughly and
noisily flushes out the victim's system
(which may be inconvenient in certain
circumstances), giving them an immediate
saving throw against the disease with a +2
bonus.
Veritus Charm(500gp): This holy
charm, if worn openly around the neck,
allows the target of level draining attacks
(that wouldn't normally allow a save) a
saving throw at -2 against level drain.

Black Barmuth
ArmorClass: 4 [15]
Hit Dice: 6
Attacks: 6 tentacles (1d6) or bite (2d8)
Saving Throw: 11
Special: see text
Move: 3
Challenge Level/XP: 8/800
The Black Barmuth is a bog-dwelling
amphibian monstrosity that lurks just
beneath the surface, waiting to grab and eat
unwary passersby (1-in-4 chance of
surprise). The Barmuth has 6 tentacles
surrounding its massive frog-like maw, each
tipped with a barbed hook. A successful hit
from one of the tentacles hooks deep into the
victim for 1d6 damage, and the victim is
held and squeezed for an additional 1d4
damage each round. Held victims will be
dragged into the Barmuth's maw in 1d4
rounds and chewed upon for 2d8 points of
damage. Victims forcibly freed from the
hooked tentacles sustain an additional 1d4
points of damage. It is rumored that an
armor-plated version of this beast, the Red
Barmuth, lurks in desert areas.
Bog Zombies
Armor Class: 6 [13]
Hit Dice: 2
Attacks: 2 claws (1d6)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Immune to sleep, charm; diseased
Move: 12
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Bog Zombies appear as black, leathery,
undead humanoids with nooses pulled tight
around their necks. Unlike their mundane
brethren, Bog Zombies are fast and possess
a malicious cunning. Any time maximum
damage (6) is rolled for a Bog Zombie hit,
the victim contracts a rotting disease, taking
an additional hp of damage per day. The
diseased wound will not heal naturally, and
requires magical assistance. Bog Zombies
often travel in packs of a dozen or more.
Keerkas
Armor Class: 7 [12]
Hit Dice: 2
Attacks: 2 tentacles (1d4)
Saving Throw: 16
Special: Paralysis, Flight
Move: 9
Challenge Level/XP: 3/60
Keerkas appear to be green, mossy, gasfilled
jelly-fish that float in the air several
feet above the ground; roughly the size of
sheep, with dozens of hanging tentacles.
Two of these tentacles are used for attacks,
and are coated with a paralytic poison (lasts
1d4 turns unless a saving throw is made).
Paralyzed victims are enveloped in the other
tentacles, and digested at a rate of 1d8 points
of damage per round. Keerkas typically
travel in schools of 7-12, though once every
4 years they swarm together into schools
numbering in the hundreds, terrorizing the
lands beyond the bog.
Drill Leech
Attack: 1hp/day
Special: Numbing poison
Challenge Level/XP: 1/15
The Drill Leech is a tiny, leech-like creature
that inhabits shallow waters and bogs. It
possesses a drill-bit-like head that secretes a
numbing agent, making it unlikely that a
victim will even notice it has been made to
host the parasite (1 in 10 chance), as the
Drill Leech embeds itself fully into the flesh
of the host's foot or leg. The victim will lose
1hp/day (this will not heal normally) until
the Drill Leech is discovered and removed
either through magical means (Cure Disease
will work) or by a healer familiar with the
parasite.
