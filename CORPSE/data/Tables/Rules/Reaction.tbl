At war If the two groups come into contact, they'll fight each other or run. If the player characters are perceived as being allied with one group by the other, they'll have a severe penalty on any attempts to make friends. If the delvers present evidence that they've attacked one of the groups to the other, they'll have a bonus on such attempts.
Hostile If the two groups come into contact, they'll often end up fighting each other. They certainly won't allow the other group to pass through their territory. If the delvers are perceived as being allied with one group by the other, they'll have a penalty on any attempts to make friends. This penalty will be less than if the groups were at war. If the player characters are being persecuted by one group, the other will usually shelter them, if only out of spite.
Allied The two groups are quite friendly. They'll at least listen to the other group's opinion and discuss with them if possible, when deciding what to do with the player characters. If the player characters are perceived as being hostile to one group, they'll have a severe penalty on any attempt to make friends with the other.
Strongly Allied The two groups will regard an attack on the other as an attack on them. They'll usually respect the decision of the other group in regard to how to treat the player characters.
Wary The two groups would like to destroy each other, but fear the results of open conflict. If the delvers are perceived as being allied with one groups by the other, they'll have a penalty on any attempt to make friends. This penalty will be about the same as if the groups were hostile. The two groups are likely to help the player characters with any plan which will weaken the other group, but only if they can do so in a way that allows them to deny involvement.
No Contact The two groups have no resource that they both want, and no way to beneficially work together. They're thus neither allied nor opposed. Re-roll this result if you want every group to be involved in a conflict.

They will attack or harass anyone who enters their territory.
They will allow travellers to pass through their territory by a particular route, but attack them if they leave the route. They may also attack travellers who stop for too long.
They may hide from travellers, or attack them, depending on how strong the travellers seem.
They will hide from travellers. If cornered they will fight or give in, depending on how strong the travellers seem. If the travellers take any of their goods they may pursue them.
They will be friendly to strangers, but won't give any help unless it's paid for (payment isn't necessarily in the form of currency). If the travellers are obviously close to death they will help, but expect payment afterwards. If the travellers take something without paying there is likely to be violence - either immediately if they're powerful enough, or as soon as they can call the sheriff / get a mob together.
As above, but if the travellers are close to death they will help without expecting payment.
As above, As above, but if the travellers are close to death they will help without expecting payment, and they will give information for free, only expecting payment for more substantial forms of help.
They will give food, water and shelter to any travellers without expecting payment, but out of duty rather than inclination. They won't offer any help unless asked, or unless the travellers are obviously in a bad way, and will grudgingly give the minimum their code allows.
They will willingly give food, water and shelter and offer any information they can, without expecting payment.
As above, but if able they will willingly give other help, for example offering fresh horses or volunteering to guide the strangers.
Roll twice more, ignoring this result or the one below. The better result applies to their own kin, the worse result to anyone else. 'Kin' may mean members of their own species, or a sub-group of that species, or a group defined in another way such as followers of a particular religion.
Their reaction may be any that appear on this table, depending on a complicated system of omens, their mood at the time, or other factors: roll for each individual group of travellers, or even each individual traveller. There should be no rhyme or reason to their actions - they may attack a large well-armed group but hide from an individual, then give their best horses to speed the journey of the next person who passes through.

The monster takes hostile or violent action because of an outside influence. Perhaps the monster is charmed, acting under compulsion from another creature that is holding its young hostage, etc.
Something happened recently to make the monster angry and hostile to the world in general. Negotiation is unlikely to succeed unless it resolves the cause of this underlying anger.
The monster would prefer to be aggressive toward the party, but something holds it in check. Perhaps it is acting under orders, has taken a vow, or is favorably disposed to one aspect of the PCs� appearance despite hating the rest.
The monster would be favorably inclined to the party except for one nagging detail. Perhaps it is prejudiced against one particular party member, or upset about a past action of the PCs.
Something happened recently to make the monster happy and well-disposed to everyone it meets. Negotiation is likely to succeed unless the PCs seem inclined to take away the thing that is making the monster happy (a pile of treasure, a tasty human baby).
The monster receives the party enthusiastically due to mistaken identity or a belief that they fulfill a prophesy. All will go well as long as the PCs continue to conform to the monster�s expectations.

Friendly Reactions with Evil Humanoids (d8)

1) Their most recent raid has been fruitful and you've encountered this pack in the midst of celebrating over a cask of pillaged elven wine. Instead of being violent drunks, the wine has pacified the creatures and all they want to do is laugh, drink, and be merry. They'll sober up quickly if the party reacts in a hostile manner.

2) The leader of the group you've encountered is smitten with the party negotiator (the one using his or her reaction adjustment for this roll). The other orcs follow the leader's orders, and the leader will communicate his or her passions in orcish or a stilted, broken form of the common tongue.

3) A respected elder in this group is gravely injured or afflicted with a terrible illness and this party has been looking for aid as their tribal healers are unable to treat the victim. The group will beseech the party for assistance and will escort them to any nearby landmark in exchange for this aid.

4) These humanoids belong to a tribe that is currently at war with a rival humanoid clan. They will want to recruit the party's assistance in this matter, offering to lead the party towards their home and the riches contained within. They will offer to share a meal with the group and attempt to convince them of the (relative) wickedness of their rivals.

5) These humanoids are part of a hunting party, searching for a specific beast somewhere within the dungeon/surrounding area. The beast may be preying on their tribe, or it may have some ritual significance to the tribe and killing it may be part of a rite of passage for these hunters. They'd like to know if the group has encountered this beast and if possible recruit their assistance in the hunt.

6) This group believes that they are clearly outmatched by the party and do not want to needlessly sacrifice their lives. They have heard tales of the generosity and kind-hearted nature of the civilized races, and believe that by feigning friendliess they will be able to escape with their lives. They will freely provide information about the immediate surroundings, though they won't lead the party to their camp. This group may become hostile later, setting up an ambush once they've secured greater numbers or alerted their tribe of the party's presence.

7) These well-armed humanoids are on a trading mission, bearing skins and slaves for trade and looking to bring back coin for their leader. They normally trade with a local duergar/bandit/drow/whatever, but the party looks like they may have the coin to offer a better price for their goods. The captured slaves may be from the party's base of operations, and there may be a reward for their return. If approached with hostility, the group would threaten the slaves' lives first before defending themselves. They'd much rather get back to their leader with money in hand than risk losing their lives unnecessarily.

8) These humanoids have been traveling for a very long time and have run out of supplies. They're hungry and thirsty and only want to make it back to their tribe. They think they're on the right path and will ask the party for any food or water they can spare. In exchange, they may provide directions or warn the group of other hostile inhabitants of the dungeon/wilderness.
