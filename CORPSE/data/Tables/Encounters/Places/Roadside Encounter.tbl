For as far as you can see, the road has been pounded into a nearly impassable, mucky mess. You may navigate it at much reduced speed, or risk an adjacent murk of a wood for a chance at quicker passage. 
Four children chase a pig. 
Four days of rain and even your oiled tarps are starting to fail. This must be a supernatural or magical storm? Are you getting closer to the source to father away from the trouble? 
Four drunken sailors stagger down the road, singing bawdy songs and holding on to wenches. The girls look at you with grins. 
Four goblins clad in loin cloths burst out of the bushes and accost the party with piteous cries. They beg the party to rescue them from pursuing slavers. Seconds later the party hears creatures fast approaching.

Gnomes hold a yard sale. 
Golden eyes follow the party in the distance and a howl is let loose as either a warning or a beckoning.

Guys, I nearly stepped on this miniscule caravan that looks just like ours.... 
Gypsies have set up a camp at the crossroads. 
Hairs rise on the back of a character's neck. It feels as if someone is watching them. Then they hear a whispered message. (For reference, the PC is on the receiving end of a Scry and Message cast through a Scry.) 
He's Flimme, I'm Flamme, and have we got a deal for you! 
Heard before it is seen, a crying child sits alone in the middle of the road.

In a night passage through the woods, your party's scout stops everyone, motioning for silence. As everyone becomes still, whispers come from among the trees on either side, the words indistinct. 
In a passage tightly walled with tall cliff faces, some of the cobblestones are blackened. Contact with these stones leaves scorches and burns on any exposed limbs. They seem to be increasing in number as the road progresses.

It becomes intensely silent. The effect ends abruptly if one steps beyond a certain area. 
It begins raining cats and dogs. Literally. 
It is dark and a commoner stands next to a wagon with a torch, yelling a woman's name and begging her to come back.

It is known this road leads straight to the next {settlement:common} with no side paths. Nevertheless, the road forks. A well-dressed attendant offers his counsel on which path to take. 
It is said many gods walk the land as mortals. Could the beautiful being bathing in the stream be one? 
It started as a milk run, but the young noble you are charged with escorting has developed a bladder infection, and now the need for rest stops has become ridiculously frequent. 
It's early dawn. Out of a thick fog a tall figure emerges. 
Jumping cobblestones. 
Jumping over these puddles would be a far easier a task if the road did not run right through a swampy bog landscape.

The kobolds have tracked the eggs to the wagon, killing the rogue en route a few miles away. 
Kobolds burst out of the forest in panic in front of the party. What has them running?

Localized radiation. 
Localized unseasonable weather confronts the party (for example, snow in the summer). 
Loud tribal shouts can be heard from about a mile ahead. Must be another local custom you need to adapt to before you make first contact. 
Many arrowheads pierce the ground, their shafts sticking out at many angles. Closer inspection reveals them to be no common hunting arrow. 
Many years of spilled blood at a contested crossroads has lent the road itself a dark sentience. Those who camp nearby suffer nightmares and the attacks of evil ghosts. 
Markings of a dangerous tribe line the road. 
Mid-storm, the party reaches a rushing, swollen river only to find the bridge has been washed away. A bedraggled figure stands in the shelter of the wreckage. He gestures at the PCs with urgency.

Minor royalty rides by in secure carriage, escorted by four heavily armed guards. 
Minor royalty rides by on a sedan chair. Then one of its bearers trips on a rock. The noble screams, "Careful, idiots! I nearly dropped my meal." You notice a sealed parchment left behind on the ground. 
Mmmm, the sweet smell of tarts and pies fill the air. Right in front of you are the cooling pies and sweet treats nicely placed on a raised stone table. No gnomes, halflings or fairies about. Perhaps they would not miss a tart or two.

Murdered travelers litter the road - they begin to animate. 
Natives accuse the party of sacrilege and desecration, their ancient burial ground disrupted. 
Near a bend in the road, the group spots two creatures fighting over a tattered cloth.

Left with only their undergarments, the ravaged corpses leave few clues as to their origin. 
Near the road a nest of massive red eggs rests snugly under a large bush. 
Near the road is a mound the size of a grave, obviously of recent excavation, marked at its head by an upright stake. 
Noble Robin Hood-type outlaws request the party's aid in recovering one of their own captured by an evil overlord.

Off to one side of the road you see a patch of glowing, flowering plants nobody recognizes.

On a bridge, the PCs hear the roar of water much louder than the river they cross. Then the river level drops. Sounds of combat upstream reach the PCs' ears. At the battle site, mercenaries are trying to capture a water elemental. The elemental is good-aligned and will appeal to the party for help. The mercenaries, if aided, will not split their bounty from the wizard who hired them.

On a desert trail, an oasis appears with several recently-dead animals lying around the water hole. 
On a forgotten mountain path below a run-down keep, a squad of elderly soldiers in tattered armour challenges the group. They still loyally hold their position for a war that ended decades ago. 
On a large road, a ship on wheels manned by eccentric road-pirates assaults the party. 
On a wooded trail, just around a turn in the road, a rope has been strung between two trees high enough to catch a mounted rider. A horse, still saddled, grazes nearby and there's blood smeared on a nearby tree. 
On an icy slope, someone has poured water down the trail turning it into a nearfrictionless slide into a gulch/chasm/pit/cavern. 
On the inside corner in the road is a campsite with people.

(The price is cheap, and you might even lead the PCs to believe the ball works when they try to use it for petty things, but it is unreliable, maybe even cursed. And the big problem is that one or more groups of NPCs badly want this crystal ball.)

Screams of pain come from a covered wagon on the road's shoulder.

So treacherous is the road, one of your mounts has thrown a shoe that cannot be found. There was no smith in the {settlement:common} you left behind.

Someone has scattered caltrops across the road.

Then the human settlement blames the PCs for bringing the might of the goblins down on the area.

The motionless figures blocking the road are a goblin war party turned to stone. 
The muffled cries of a kitten draw your attention to the side of the road. A burlap sack with something wiggling inside it lies in the brush. (Upon opening the bag flip a coin. Heads: it's a normal kitten - a bit hungry but otherwise unharmed. Tails: it's a dead cat. The cat died of hunger several days ago. If the PCs just close the bag after finding the dead cat, it will start wiggling and crying again. Any time the bag  is opened, flip a coin again.

The party finds an abandoned cart and pony, in good condition and with some supplies, near a clear trail that leads to a cave.

You decide to camp not far from the roadside, but while setting up, a ghost rises up and tries to possess you.
