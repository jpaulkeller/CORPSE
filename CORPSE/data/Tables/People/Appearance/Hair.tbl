is matted mass of locks and knots, a wild revelry of umber waves that seem to defy {G.possessive} every attempt to tame it.
is cut in a severe bowl, perfectly trimmed so that it but touches the upper rims of {G.possessive} ears and cuts a sharp line of black across {G.possessive} forehead, leaving the nape of {G.possessive} neck naked to the wind.
is of the lightest flaxen hue and pulled back into a luxurious tail that hangs braided down between {G.possessive} shoulder blades, feathers and beads and lucky tokens woven into its mass.
a riot of curls, iron in coloration like the blade of a serviceable weapon, a crown that {G.pronoun} is forced to wear despite {G.possessive} obvious attempts to shear it off.
is cut in a soldier's style, clean and close to the scalp, so that the architecture of {G.possessive} skull is visible to all, its angles and prominences.
is but an intimation, a few curls about {G.possessive} ears as the clouds might circle the base of a vertiginous mountain, {G.possessive} scalp a torrid mass of scars that interlace like mating slugs where the rest of {G.possessive} hair was seared away.
heavily oiled and shaped, gleaming wetly and strangely static, not moving even with the sharpest of turns of {G.possessive} head.

: Beard Detail
His face is clean shaven, but recently so--the skin over his jowls and upper lip are more pallid than the rest of his skin, soft and almost cadaverous in texture.
He sports the beginning of a beard, faint curls that climb across the length of his jawline and nestle on his upper lip, either the product of a week's growth or the frustrating results of months attempts to prove his manliness.
He wears a sharp, thickly grown beard that might once have been a mighty growth--recently it was chopped just beneath the jawline, giving his face a severe and harsh frame.
A long braid grows from his chin, thick as his wrist and reaching his sternum. Otherwise his facial hair is cropped close.
A mass of thin braids descend from his cheeks, jowls and chin like a seething nest of snakes.
