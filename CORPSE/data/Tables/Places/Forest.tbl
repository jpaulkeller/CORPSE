A boggy part of the wood with willow and rowan trees, tall grasses and yellowing bushes, pools, bogs, trickling streams and mud pools are everywhere.
A hilly area, with banks and hillocks all covered with bushes and low trees, rabbit and vole holes pepper the banks, wagtails hop and flutter from bank to bank.
Blackened stumps and rotting trunks, trees spotted with fungus and leaf mold stinking underfoot.
Grim and dark, trees weighed down with centuries of moss, bowing low to the ground.
Light and airy, with tall trees separated by leafy spaces.
Pine forest, dark and soulless, soundless and dead, brown needles create a silent carpet, not a breath of air stirs, not a bird call or insect can be heard.
Pine forest, with tall majestic trees and a springy litter of brown needles and pine cones, here and there saplings and bushes push up into the wide spaces.
Rich green leaves, trees open and leafy, birds filling the air with song.
Stark area of withered trees, many leafless, the ground scattered with underbrush and branches.
