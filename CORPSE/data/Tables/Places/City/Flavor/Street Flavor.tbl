filled with the scent of burning wood
full of beggars and thieves
infested by packs of wild dogs, and worse
lined with street vendors hawking maps and scrolls
strangely empty and silent
strewn with the rubble and debris of a collapsed building
the right place to go if youâ€™re looking for a {profession}
where men of rank or privilege who require discretion look for ladies of the night
where most of the {{profession:craftsman}+} work
where most of the {{profession:merchant}+} have their shops
where the {{profession:entertainer}+} gather to perform and panhandle
