a dugout behind the sentinel rock
a stone room built into the inside of the well
among the tall corn plants
in the back of the church
in the church’s belltower
the cellar under the inn
the coal shed at the smithy
the mayor’s office
the old windmill
the ruined keep at the crest of the hill
the stables
under the dock meetings at low tide
