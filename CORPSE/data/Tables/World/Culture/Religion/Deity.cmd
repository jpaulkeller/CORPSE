2. Portfolio

In many RPGs and in most mythology, gods and goddesses hold dominion over certain aspects of creation. For example, Ares in Greek mythology was a god of war, and Hel in Nordic mythology was a goddess of the underworld. These aspects of reality that a god has influence over are known as their portfolio.

You want to create a portfolio so each god's identity, responsibilities, and powers are easy to conceptualize, plot, and roleplay. A portfolio also gives you and the players a sense of a god's power level and place in the grand scheme of your campaign world. For example, a sky god sounds more powerful than a rain god because the concept of sky encompasses more.

Pick a portfolio for the god. Use the table below if stuck for ideas.

d10   General Portfolio May Have Influence Over Suggested Suffixes For Names
1  Creators/high gods   These gods tend to be heads of pantheons or the first gods who began the creation of a campaign world. They tend to be withdrawn from day-to-day affairs.   Most high, allfather, the creator, supreme one, great one.
2  Mother/Earth deities Generally benevolent, these goddesses tend to be forces of creation and renewal, although they can also have a destructive side, clearing away the old to make way for the new.  Allmother, world mother, mother earth, mother nature, Gaia.
3  Sea and sky The sea and sky are often some of the first things created in real-world mythologies, so these deities tend to be older and quite powerful. They can also be mercurial and changeable in their whims in the same way the weather conditions in their domain can rapidly alter.   Lord of the Deep places, Windrider, Windwalker, Master of the Oceans, Seaking, Thunderer, Rainmaker.
4  Animals and hunting  Many mythologies contain gods that change into animal forms. However, gods of hunting and animals are naturalistic and often savage, feeling more at home in a forest hunting than resting in a divine palace. Lord of the Hunt, Claw God, Beastlord, Lady of the Forest, Greentooth.
5  Fertility and agriculture  These gods and goddesses tend to arise when humanity or other civilised species begin to farm and tame the land. They hold dominion of the growing season and survival of crops, making them very important figures for most agrarian societies.   Ploughlord, Lady of the Fields, Court of the Seasons.
6  Love, childbirth and the home Love has been a great force throughout human history, inspiring hope, despair, and some of the greatest works of literature. Deities who hold dominion over the human heart are both widely praised but also potentially feared for the power they hold. The more caring and nurturing side of these deities is often seen when they protect the young and the home. Heart's desire, Lord of Longing, Young-bringer, Hearthguard, Lord of Hearth and Home.
7  Fate and fortune  There are many things in life (especially in worlds where magic exists) that cannot be explained. People ascribe such phenomena to the vagaries of fate or the whims of fortune. The lucky, Prophet, Lord of what is known, Lady of the Veils, Master of the unknown way.
8  Trickster gods In many real-world mythologies there are odd figures often used to justify seemingly random or haphazard events. These tricksters exist to stir things up and create chaos. Their actions seem random and cruel, but sometimes they do have a deeper hidden meaning. Lady of Chaos, The Mad, The Trickster, Lord of Madness, Chaos Incarnate.
9  War   Conflict and violence is almost inevitable in life, from a minor scuffle to larger wars that engulf nations and involve hundreds of people. People invoke their gods of war hoping they will secure them victory in whatever challenges they face on the battlefield.   The Bloody, The Red-Handed God, Lady of Pain, Lord of Suffering, Master at Arms, Lady of Honour and Duty.
10 Death and the Underworld   What happens after you die has puzzled and frightened mankind since the earliest days of civilisation. Most nations and people have their myths about what happens when the soul passes on, so it is not surprising there is often a god or goddess who rules the realm of the dead.   Half-rotten, Lord of the Dead, Lady of the Damned, Shadowborn, Worm-eaten.



3. Myth

What is the most well-known myth associated with the god?

We know gods from the myths and stories told about them by their worshippers and the rest of society. Through these stories we catch a glimpse of a god's character and how they behave towards normal people.

By establishing a popular or well-known myth about your god, you begin to build up a framework of stories about your pantheon. This adds a great deal to your background and also provides you with a ready-made answer when a PC asks, 'What do I know about Krask the goddess of the rains?'

Below are a number of frameworks or seeds you can use to create the basic outline of a myth for deities. Replace sections [underlined and in brackets] with information from your own campaign to personalise the myth. Then use the seed to flesh the myth out later on, when you have time – just get the seed crafted for now.


World Creation

[The god] uses [a part of themselves/something they constructed from the raw matter of the world/remnants of a previous creation] to create [an important part of the world].


Monster Creation

A [mortal protagonist] steals [an item or power] from the gods. [The god] curses the mortal for daring to steal from the gods, transforming them into [a monster].


The Quest

[The god] requires a service to be performed for them in [your world's name]. But because they are forbidden from interfering by [ancient pact/the laws of heaven/the intervention of the other gods] they empower [a mortal] to undertake the task on their behalf.


Fate

[The god] is dying due to a [curse/the passage of time/a prophesied event/an attack from another god]. The god [accepts/rails against] their fate and [passes peacefully/struggles but ultimately succumbs/temporarily fends of their doom/is able to overcome their doom] by [accepting their place in the cosmos/adopting a sense of fatalism/recruiting others to help it escape its fate/creating a proxy to die in its place/procuring the services of a trickster god to help it/hiding from its fate].


The Villain

[The god] becomes enamoured of a [mortal] and procreates with them, creating a [hideous monster/demi-god/a great hero or powerful villain].


The Test

[The god] sets a series of tests for [mortal]. If the mortal passes, they will be given great power and may go on to found [a religion] based around [the god].


The Metaphor

A [natural part of the world] is actually [god] [crying/angry/love/fighting/running/hunting].




4. Manifestation

How do the god's worshippers depict the deity?

When a god is worshipped it will typically be portrayed in artwork created by its worshippers (unless deliberately not depicting the deity is a tenet of that religion). If all gods in the pantheon are depicted in a similar way, you create consistency in your pantheon. You also now have a tool to reveal different faces of a god seen through the eyes of its religions and cults.

Use the table below to see how the god is often depicted. Note, various religions might portray a god differently. The result from the table is just the depiction most people in your campaign world would be familiar with.

d6 Depiction
1  Deity is portrayed as a human.
2  Deity is portrayed as an animal.
3  Deity is represented by an abstract symbol or sign.
4  Deity is represented by a natural force, such as a crashing wave or fork of lightning.
5  Deity is represented as a combination of two of the results on the table. Roll twice and apply the results. 

For example: If you roll 1 and 4 you may choose to have your sea deity be a bearded man whose hair is the white foam of a crashing wave.
6  Deity is not depicted at all, since to do so would be an insult to the god or goddess in question.



5. Rituals

What ceremonies and offerings does the god expect? How often are they expected?

Most gods in RPGs require some form of offering or sacrifice from their worshippers or common folk who wish to placate them. For instance, a fisherman going out in stormy weather might offer a prayer to the god of the sea that he return home safely. A farmer might burn a small part of his crop as an offering to the gods of the fields that his next harvest be equally as bountiful.

We chose to emphasise this in our Mythic God Generator because the idea of rituals and sacrifices provide such rich fodder for roleplay. The idea of stopping a nefarious ritual or of trying to obtain a rare item for an important sacrifice (to name just two) provides ready-made ideas for scenarios and quests for all PCs.

Roll once on the table below to determine the preferred offering of your god and then again to determine how frequently the god demands such offerings.

Roll  d6 Preferred Offering   d6 Frequency Demanded
1  Offering of produce associated with the god. Such as fish for a sea god, crops for an earth goddess.  When a person is about to embark on a venture that involves the god's portfolio.
2  Offering of precious gems or rare items.  Every morning.
3  Burning of incense or fragrant herbs.  Every evening.
4  Prayers to the deity.   Before or after meals.
5  Blood sacrifice.  Only at religious festivals.
6  A living sacrifice.  Once a year on a day or night holy to the deity.



6. Divine Rewards & Punishments

How does the god reward true believers and punish those who work against it?

In a roleplay game, a god normally provides certain benefits to those devout worshippers who run its temples and sing praises to it. Conversely, they also punish those who blaspheme against them or oppose their worship. Such blessings as punishments are a staple of real-world mythology and offer plenty of potential for roleplaying, being one of the few reliable methods of communicating with (many) gods.

As a GM, having some idea when you create your gods of how they might choose to reward or punish mortals allows you to play them consistently and also to show the divine hand at work in your setting.

Roll or choose from the table below for the god's primary method of rewarding the faithful and for their preferred method of punishing those who fall from their favour.

d6 Result   Notes
1  Good health.   A physical affliction.
2  A boon related to the god's portfolio. Madness.
3  Material wealth.  They are pursued by a divine servant of the god.
4  Magical abilities.   A quest, test, or ordeal.
5  A divine companion.  Cursed and transformed into a monster or creature.
6  Great knowledge.  An ability related to the god's portfolio that comes with a powerful downside.



Example Deities

Below are three deities created using the tables above as examples of how the Mythic God Generator can be used.


Name: Criador the Allfather

Portfolio: Creator/High God

Most well known myth: A creation myth where Criador used his own body to create the world, leaving him as an ephemeral spirit.

Manifestation: Since he has no body, Criador is presented by a simple circle showing he is both everything and nothing.

Rituals: Burning of incense or fragrant herbs every morning.

Reward: Those who earn Criador's favour - usually master craftsmen and those who work to build things or who sacrifice of themselves - will occasionally when struggling with a project find themselves visited by a divine servant of Criador in the guise of an ancient carpenter who will discuss their problem with them.

Most people who have been visited by the woodworker come away with a tremendous insight into their current situation and often a solution.

Punishment: Most often those who have great skill but who turn it to dark or selfish ends find their ability becomes ever more supreme, but that everything they create invariably brings misfortune and ill-luck to those who touch it.

Alternatively, they might receive a divine companion or ability with a dark side.



Name: Sorte, Lady of the Grey Veils

Portfolio: Fate and fortune

Most well known myth: The previous god of fate, Fortuna was dying as his prophesied time reached its end. Fortuna accepted his fate and passed peacefully. The other gods worried the forces of fate and luck would rage out of control. But from the fading light of Fortuna's dying being, a last ember flared into life and from it stepped Sorte, fate reborn.

Manifestation: Sorte is portrayed as a faceless female figure wrapped in a black cloak that contains all the stars of the night sky.

Rituals: Prayers once a year on a holy night.

Reward & Punishment: Those who have Sorte's favour find themselves untroubled by illness and the general vagaries of fate. Those who earn her wrath find themselves dogged by small gnome-like creatures, servants of the Lady of the Grey Veils capable of manipulating the forces of probability.



Name: Coração Heartguard

Portfolio: Love, childbirth, and the home

Most well known myth: When a newborn child cries for the first time in their home, it is said the sound is actually Coração signalling to all that a new life has entered the world and it is under his protection.

Manifestation: Coração is portrayed as a great cat who curls up near the door of homes to protect them from intruders.

Rituals: Prayers every evening.

Reward & Punishment: People who earn Coração's favour find themselves blessed with the knowledge to protect those they love and care about, being able to sense when a family member of a loved one is in trouble no matter how much distance separates them.

Those who have angered Coração find they gain a similar ability to sense when their loved ones are in danger or threaten. However, no matter what they do or how much they struggle to help them, they invariably arrive too late to prevent the danger.
