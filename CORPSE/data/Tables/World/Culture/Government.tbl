. Government, Description

Anarchism; A form of government with no ruling hierarchy, instead decisions are made at a directly democratic level: laws are created by citizens alone, although they may be enforced by institutions that are not publicly controlled.
Anarchy; A lack of a central government, as there is no one recognized governing authority; in anarchy there is no effective government and each individual has absolute liberty. It is important to note, however, that the lack of a government to enforce laws does not automatically imply that there are no laws; anarcho-capitalism in particular posits a form of anarchy with a body of explicit laws.
Aristocracy; A form of government in which a select few rule based on inherited hereditary right.
Autocracy; A form of government in which the political power is held by a single, self-appointed ruler.
Communist state; A hypothetical stateless entity that follows after socialism as according to Marxist theory.
Corporatocracy; A form of government where a corporation, a group of corporations, or government entities with private components, control the direction and governance of a country.
Demarchy; A hypothetical political system run by randomly selected decision makers who have been selected by sortition. Think selecting a legislature or executive in the same manner that a jury is presently selected.
Democracy; Refers to a broad range of types of government based upon the "consent of the governed."

Epistemocracy; A utopian type of society and government in which people of rank, including those holding political office, are those who possess epistemic humility.
Ethnocracy; A form of government where representatives of a particular ethnic group hold a number of government posts disproportionately large to the percentage of the total population that the particular ethnic group(s) represents and use them to advance the position of their particular ethnic group(s) to the detriment of others. In Nazi Germany ethnic groups Hitler supported held all the power. Neo-Nazis often accuse Jews of possessing an ethnocracy in the person of the U.S. government, which they call the Zionist Occupation Government.
Exilarchy; A form of government, usually theocratic or monarchic, that is established and constituted for rule over an ethnic or religious diaspora rather than over the place of origin whence the diaspora originates.
