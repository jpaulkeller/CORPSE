1-2   1-2   They'll kill everyone, even if they try to surrender.
1-2   3-4   As above, but they'll take some captives (roll again: 1-3 as slaves 4-6 to ransom).
1-2   5-6   They'll give their victims the chance to surrender, but if they refuse they'll try to kill everyone.
3-4   1-2   They're mostly interested in capturing people to ransom them.
3-4   3-4   They'll try to negotiate a 'fee' for allowing their victims safe passage.
3-4   5-6   'Your lupins or your life!' They're obsessed with one unusual form of goods - eg only red clothing, or only clocks. They'll let anyone go who doesn't have this item. They'll try to kill anyone who has a relevant item and refuses to hand it over.
5-6   1-2   As above, but their demands change from one set of victims to the next.
5-6   3-4   They won't attack (roll again: 1-2 poor people 3 priests 4 anyone but agents of the hated government 5 members of their own religion 6 members of their own species if your campaign world has more than one intelligent species, or their nationality if there's only one intelligent species). Roll again, ignoring this result if you get it again, for their treatment of everyone else.
5-6   5-6   They're mostly interested in driving people out of their territory. If their victims turn around and leave they won't pursue them. Roll again, ignoring this result or the one above, for what they'll do if their victims refuse.
