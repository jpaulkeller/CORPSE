+1 Longsword: This cursed (or possibly just self-important) blade will magically appear in your hand whenever you engage in combat or try to draw a weapon other than itself. You can sheathe it again just fine, but it’ll leap back to your hand the next time its magic is triggered. It has no other bonuses or drawbacks
1 rung of a magical ladder. The ladder worked in such a way that you could place a rung in the air and it would stay there. With 2 you could make a fairly effective ladder
A 1″ x 3″ stone box that contains the voice and persona of a mad inventor
A chair that can levitate. A lever on its side controls levitation height. The wizard who made it screwed up – it was supposed to be able to raise itself a few feet so that the sitter could adjust its height to match a variety of tables, but he misplaced a decimal point
A coin that always lands on heads for the person attuned to it.
A copper circlet inlaid with onyx stones which allows its wearer to breathe underwater
A cursed ring that couldn’t be removed once you put it on. It made all edible food look repulsive and required a will save to eat. Some inedible things (like acid from an acid pit) become tempting and require a will save to not stuff it in your face
A hat that makes a person strong where he or she is weak and vice-versa
A large magical orb that is actually the missing eyeball of a one-eyed dragon. Touching the orb will show you whatever the dragon’s other eye is gazing on (including blackness if it is shut). Likewise, the dragon can see through the orb if it concentrates on it
A luck stone, actually a phylactery that acts like an amulet of inescapable location. So a party may be unwittingly guarding a lich, who knows where they are all the time
A mask made to look like an elf screaming that when worn puts the wearer to sleep and causes nightmares
A mirror that reflects the inner most desire of anyone that looks into it
A pair of boots that cause any sound effects to be treated as solid objects for one round after they kick in, and generally treat sound as solid. Made for fun acrobatic tricks and 3D movement from what would have otherwise been attack powers
A pair of earrings which, when worn, let you understand animal speech. While wearing them, however, humanoid speech will sound like gibberish
A pair of gauntlets that weight 1 ton each , except when worn.
A ring that revivifies nearby dead things. They re-die when the ring moves out of range
A ring which, the salesman says, will make your finger disappear – except it doesn’t just disappear, but is actually a tiny portal to the dimension of the fey kingdom. (Imagine sending tiny letters into it, or throwing it into a lake and causing flooding and loss of mermaids’ habitat)
A rod of mysterious white metal that outlines everyone within 10′ in fairy fire
A rusted iron crown which, when placed on someone’s head, levitates a few inches and ignites into a brilliant halo of flame. The flames are illusory, and produce no heat, but have highly convincing visual, auditory, and olfactory components
A scroll covered in elaborate script. All attempts at translating will fail, but leave translator sure they’re close to cracking it. Has an air of great worth, will always appraise high. Catches on fire if within 3’ of an open flame, burns bright, but is never consumed or otherwise damaged by flame. (It’s actually a gag ever-burning torch.)
A sentient ring with the personality like that of a serial killer
A set of 1″ spheres, one each of Copper, Brass, Gold, Silver, and Bronze that glow when around a dragon of the same color.
A small sculpture of a wren, made of brass, silver, and glass. When the command is given, the wren begins to sing, in the voice of a long-dead (but very popular in her day) performer. Its secondary function is to allow anyone who had the scrying crystal linked to it, and who knew the proper words of command, to see through the wren’s eyes
A stone that records the dreams of anyone that sleeps with it under their pillow
A wand that takes a random body part from its target and grafts it onto or into its wielder
Aardvark Brooch: Wearer develops a craving to eat ants
Acorn of Acuity: +5 to survival checks
All-Seasons Scabbard: As long as a sword is kept in this scabbard the wearer suffers no ill effects from extreme weather
Amulet of Rain Detection: This amulet allows it’s wearer to detect when it’s raining, not before, only during. It only works outdoors
Amulet of Silence: Nothing within a foot of the holder of this amulet can cause any sound
Amulet of clear hearing: If you are deafened while wearing this amulet, you can use your reaction to end the defeaned condition. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a short rest.
Amulet of fierce vitality: If an attacker misses you with an attack while you are wearing this amulet, you can gain 15 temporary hit points as a reaction. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest.
Amulet of gradual vitality: If an attacker misses you with an attack while you are wearing this amulet, you can gain 5 temporary hit points as a reaction. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a short rest.
Amulet of lifesaving: If you fail a death saving throw while wearing this amulet, the item casts spare the dying on you. The amulet cannot cast this spell again for another 24 hours.
Amulet of light: As an action you can make the amulet to shed 15 feet of bright light and dim light in another 15. You can use another action to make the amulet stop shedding light.
Amulet of riposte: If an attacker misses you with a melee attack while you are wearing this amulet, you can make an opportunity attack against the attacker as a reaction. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest.
Amulet of shield: While wearing this amulet as an reaction you can cast shield. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest.
An amulet that makes its wearer invisible, yet makes them blind as long as they wear it
An axe that, upon a successful attack, loudly calls out random numbers in a very feminine voice. The numbers it calls out are in fact the amount of damage the axe has done on that hit, but the PCs have no idea what the numbers mean. Think LOST
An enchanted feather which allows the holder to Speak with Animals, and cast Charm Animal once per day.  
Angel Dart: If a target is whispered to the dart it may be thrown into the air, where it will fly to the target and hit it without error, regardless of distance or obstacles. The tiny dart causes no damage itself
Aqua Grease: This pale grease can be rubbed over any equipment to fully protect it from damage by water exposure 
Armadillo Cloak: Thrown around the wearer, this cloak wraps them in a protective shell. Once enclosed, they are immobile, and can act only to return the cloak to its normal form, but while thus protected, are impervious to harm
Armor of Anti-Rust Monster – A full set of plate armor impervious to a rust monster’s effects. However the effect is passed on to the wearer, who’ll turn to rust in 1d6 turns. On a successful save vs. useless items, the wearer gets to live for 1d6 years instead
Armor of Detecting Whether Someone Can Shapeshift Into a Halfling: Perfect for forcing doppelgängers to reveal their natures. Once donned, this human-sized plate armor locks itself in place and begins shrinking to halfling size. Wearers unable to shapeshift to something halfling-sized will suffer 3d6 damage per round
Armor of Indestructibility: This fine leather armor is indestructible and undamageable. It doesn’t confer this ability on its wearer and offers no additional protection
Arrow of Flinging: When a successful attack is made with this arrow, instead of the arrow launching at the intended target, the archer is flung through the air as if fired from a giant-sized bow. These and arrows of flying are usually found together
Arrow of Flying: This arrow grants a +1 to hit and, if it matters by the time it does hit, a +1 to damage. If a successful attack is made while firing this arrow it’ll fly away into the sky, zooming around this way and that, for 1d12 turns at the end of which time it’ll finally strike its target. If fired indoors, or in a dungeon the arrow will fly to the nearest exit, and take the fastest route outside so it can fly! If there are no exits it’ll buzz around like an angry hornet for however many turns are rolled, then make a bee-line straight back to the person who fired it and strike them as if they were the original target
Arrow of Returning – Forget about quivers of arrows! With this item, you need only one! However, you might want to watch yourself on its return trip
Assassin’s Bolts: These appear to be normal crossbow bolts. When fired, any bolts that miss disappear just before impact. They make no sound in doing so, though they can be spotted while traveling by an alert watcher
Athlete’s sandals: When you take the dash action, you may activate the magic of the sandals and move an extra 5 feet. You must complete a short rest before you can use this ability again.
Bag of Folding: A cumbersome suitcase of normal proportions, any clothing left inside this suitcase will come out freshly ironed, pressed and folded
Bag of Holding: This is a normal bag, with a capacity equal to a non-magical bag of its kind. However, if an item is pressed against its outside, its latches coil around it and hold it (effective strength score 20). If the bag is not holding an item, it might latch onto anything ‘holdable’ within reach, like a chair or table leg. The item itself has no compulsion to release a held object, so must be pried loose
Bag of Infinite Muffins. Exactly what it says on the tin: there’s always exactly one muffin inside the bag, no matter how many you pull out. A variety of flavors, though it’s a bit biased towards banana nut
Bag of Useless Duplication: Put any object in it, and you’ll get back an identical copy that’s useless – magic items with no magic, weapons that don’t cut, unpalatable food with no nourishment, etc
Barrel of Preserving: enchanted barrel preserves liquid stored within
Bat Sword: If this sword is tapped against something hard it rings out a tone. This allows the wielder to see in the dark or smoke as well as they can in daylight
Battle tent: This canvas tent can sleep up to 6 Medium or Small creatures and cannot be torn down by natural weather.
Beard Ring of Khordalin: Grants its wearer the daily power to randomly conjure beards on random strangers, enemies, or party members
Bearded Shield: A high-quality shield adorned with fine steel carefully worked to depict an immaculate dwarf beard. If you drink yourself into unconsciousness while carrying it, you may wake up to find yourself transformed into a dwarf
Bedroll of ultimate rest: When you sleep on this bedroll during a long rest you gain inspiration at the end of the rest.
Bedroll of vitality: When you sleep on this bedroll during a long rest you regain 1 more hit die than you normally would at the end of the rest, up to your hit die maximum.
Beeping Box: When first held by an un-gloved hand, the device seeks out the first thing described by the one who held it. When held it beeps when pointed at the closest source of what it iss detecting, beeping louder and faster as it gets closer. It can be reset by dipping it into water
Bell of Freedom: Whenever this cracked handbell is rung, any creature within earshot immediately escapes its physical and/or magical bondage. Prison doors open, manacles spring loose, and spells of holding ends; they’re free. After one ringing, the crack in the handbell spreads and the bell shatters
Bell of the Crier: As long as the holder is ringing this hand-bell their voice will carry across great distances and be audible by all within a mile
Belt of Impulsiveness: The wearer of this belt loses any meekness or caution they may have had, and will rush headlong into action without a thought
Belt of blind strength: While you are blinded and wearing this belt you gain a +1d4 bonus to damage on melee attacks.
Belt of caged strength: While you are restrained and wearing this belt you gain a +1d4 bonus to damage on melee attacks.
Belt of climbing assistance: When you fail a Strength (Athletics) check while climbing which would cause you to fall and are wearing this belt, you may activate the magic of this belt to reroll the check. You must use the new result. You must complete a short rest before using this ability again.
Belt of iron resistance: When you wear this belt as an action you are resistant to all damage until the end of your next turn. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest.
Belt of poisoned strength: While you are poisoned and wearing this belt you gain a +1d4 bonus to damage on melee attacks.
Belt of the Brawler: A wide leather belt with many notches and an outlandishly large belt buckle. When wearing it your voice booms very loudly and can even push people back several feet
Bladed Gloves: A pair of black leather gloves, each adorned with a silver dagger charm. If, while wearing these gloves, you whisper the word “Blade” while touching one of the charms, a spirit dagger (behaves like a normal dagger, but can also affect insubstantial creatures) will appear in your hand. Any daggers created by the gloves fade from existence within a minute or two after leaving your grasp
Blast Disk: land mine
Blindfolds of Stealth: Makes the user impossible to detect. Provided they don’t walk right into their opponents
Bloodfang Buckler: This item takes the form of a copper buckler, decorated in the center with a monstrous if ornate face. The shield’s rim is always irresponsibly sharp and self-injury is common. Any blood shed onto the shield is magically sucked into the mouth at the shield’s center, and vanishes into a dimensional pocket (of multi-gallon capacity) inside the shield. Upon command, the shield’s mouth can spew all its stored-up blood in a cone up to 10 feet long. Being sprayed with blood, while usually harmless, is very unsettling
Boat of Murder: If a corpse is placed inside this small rowboat, it’ll drift out on the water and return an hour later empty, with no trace of the corpse nor evidence left in the boat
Book of knowledge: While holding this book you can use an action to automatically know a single piece of lore about a specific subject. The specifics are determined by the DM. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest.
Boots of Thunder And Lightning: Only wearable by rogues, these throw a thunderbolt once per day for 4d6 lightning damage to target. However, on a failed sneak check, the boots flash and thunder on every step for 1 turn, expending their charge for the day. After a failed check, the boots are cursed and can’t be removed normally
Boots of jump: While wearing these boots as an action you can cast jump on yourself. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest.
Boots of the Trailblazer: These waterproof, weatherworn, hardened leather boots always fit perfectly and comfortably. In a pinch these boots can be used as a day’s worth of rations for a small band of travelers. Sadly, they’re consumed
Boots of the stalwart servant: If you are moved forcibly while wearing these boots you can use a reaction to reduce the movement by 5 feet. You must complete a short rest before you can use this ability again.
Bountiful Scythe: This appears to be an ordinary, though worn, farmer’s scythe. Anything (plant, animal, living or not) severed from its larger whole by this scythe becomes a similar volume of freshly-cut wheat stalks. This wheat must still be processed as usual, but it’s edible. Whether eating wheat that used to be arms, legs, and other body parts counts as cannibalism is still hotly debated
Boxers of Holding: This is a pair of very well-crafted and comfortable Male “undergarments” which besides their obvious quality appear unremarkable until donned. Once worn they act as a standard bag of holding as long as the item to be stored can fit between the “stretched waistband” and the wearer’s flesh. DM’s are encouraged to apply an appropriate Charisma negative to anyone who interacts with the wearer after witnessing the owner of these Boxers retrieve or store something from within. Sewn into the liner of above-mentioned boxers is the name G. Threepwood

Broken Dagger: This ornate dagger is snapped in half partway down its blade … and irreparable
Brooch of Returning (will animate and fly back to the owner when rubbed); red-gold studded with turquoise, in the shape of a scarab.  Opens when pinched; can hold a coin-sized object.  
Brooch of good business: While wearing this brooch you gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks used to convince merchants of the same race as you to lower a nonmagical item’s price.
Buoyant Shoes: These magical shoes float in water; a pair can support the average adventurer. Being sized and shaped like typical shoes, though, they’re very difficult to balance on properly while traversing water
Candle Beans: One bean, bitten or pinched firmly, will glow for a few seconds before igniting in a low, candle-like flame that will burn for around ten seconds. Once out, it will leave a faint trail of smoke
Candle of Focus: >While burning and visible (within 30'), provides a +2 bonus to all actions which require concentration.  Will burn for 2d6 hours.
Carpet of Infinite Delay: As a standard Carpet of flying, but may or may not fly upon command. It may also not take off when requested, or toss users off at random to allow for other passengers. It may take off hours after it was asked to
Chalice of Fealty: A silver chalice etched with a pattern of entwined snakes and fantastical creatures. When you pour red wine into the Chalice of Fealty and you give a command to another creature drinking from the chalice, they’ll do as you command … but may twist your words
Chalice of Moods: Anyone drinking from this cup must roll. On 1–3 they recall a sad memory and their mood drops. On 4–6 they feel a new vigor for life and start to smile
Charm Bracelet
Cheater’s deck: While playing a game with these cards you have advantage on any gaming set check you make.
Cheater’s dice: While playing a game with these dice you have advantage on any gaming set check you make.
Chest of Freezing: This small box instantly freezes anything that touches its insides. Be careful when you take stuff out that your fingers don’t touch it!
Chilling Sphere: This small glass sphere could easily be mistaken for a toy marble. It radiates a small, chilly aura. Prolonged contact or proximity is uncomfortable, though harmless. These simple magical items are popular for keeping beverages cold
Circlet of Thought Projection: When worn on a person’s head, causes the wearer’s thoughts to be heard in the minds of anyone nearby. The wearer may not be aware of this (they cannot hear others’ thoughts)
Cloak of Lava: This appears to be a thick cloak of fairly simple construction. When the command word is spoken, the cloak turns into an equal volume patch of fiery hot molten lava. The transformation is one way only, so each cloak of this kind functions only once. Caution, do not speak command word while wearing cloak
Cloak of the porcupine: While wearing this spine-covered cloak as an action you can release the spines in a 5-foot-radius burst. Any creatures other than you in the burst must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures who fail takes 1d8 piercing damage. It takes 12 hours to the spines to regrow on the on the cloak.
Coffee pot of the awakened: Drinking a cup of coffee or tea from this single-serving coffee pot grants you inspiration. The coffee cannot grant this benefit again for another 24 hours.
Coin Beetle: A normal looking coin. However, at night it comes to life and eats one other coin it can find, before disguising itself as a coin once again
Coin of karma: When you fail a ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you may flip this coin as a reaction. If it lands heads up, you can reroll and you must take the new result.

Compass of Harlot Detection: Points to the nearest wandering harlot
Compass of aberration finding: Speak the name of a general category of aberration (such as mind flayer or beholder) and this compass will point in the direction of the closest creature of this type for 24 hours. If the closest creature of this type dies or moves too far away to be the closest, the compass points to the new closest creature that fits the description. The compass will not accept a new category of aberration until 24 hours have passed.
Compass of beast finding: Speak the name of a general category of beast (such as mind deer or bear) and this compass will point in the direction of the closest creature of this type for 24 hours. If the closest creature of this type dies or moves too far away to be the closest, the compass points to the new closest creature that fits the description. The compass will not accept a new category of beast until 24 hours have passed.
Compass of undead finding: Speak the name of a general category of undead (such as mummy, skeleton, vampire, or zombie) and this compass will point in the direction of the closest creature of this type for 24 hours. If the closest creature of this type dies or moves too far away to be the closest, the compass points to the new closest creature that fits the description. The compass will not accept a new category of undead until 24 hours have passed.
Crimson Scimitar: Forged from blood steel and adorned with bloodstones, this finely crafted scimitar will never rust, corrode nor require sharpening so long as each day a few drops of fresh blood are smeared on the scimitar’s blade
Crown of humility: When you don this wooden crown it must stay on your head for 24 hours. While you wear it, an illusion makes you appear to others as a malnourished, ragged, filthy version of the person you truly are. People who interact with you physically can disbelieve this illusion by succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
Crystal Ship: This miniature ship is beautifully crafted and valuable, but if ever taken aboard a ship, that ship will sink before its voyage is completed
Cursing Armor: not to be confused with Cursed Armor, this is fine magical armor, of excellent craftsmanship and with magical protection bonuses. Its name comes from a curse emblazoned on its chest, in runes of glowing magical flame that shine through any covering. Written in the pure celestial tongue, the message can be understood by all sentient beings, but is beyond the pale, utterly unacceptable in any civilized society. Anyone seeing it will be shocked by its transcendental rudeness
Daern’s Instant Privy: On command it unfolds to … a small 5’ x 5’ ‘outhouse’. Inside is a water closet, bidet, bath and shower, with hot and cold running water. It’s made of adamantine, though, and although only eight feet high, the privy door is lockable and has a small crescent shaped hole in it to peer out through. Despite its silliness, it’s useful
Dancing Mechanism of Heat: This appears to be a simple mechanical device built of iron. It consists of a square base 3 inches to a side with a small gear and an actuator arm sticking up out of the top of the base. It’s normally seen with a small nail or similar object jammed into the gear’s teeth, for the reasons that follow. Unless jammed, held in place, or similarly obstructed, the gear will begin rotating, the actuator arm bobbing, all under its own volition. It starts out very slow, but grows faster the longer it’s allowed to go on. At the same time, the device warms by about 1° Celsius each minute, starting from the ambient temperature. Actual time varies, but usually after about 24 hours of continuous activity the device becomes hot enough that its components begin to melt, and the device destroys itself. If stopped before that point, the device will begin to cool down normally
Death Drum: Anyone who bangs this drum thirteen times or more will die
Death’s Emerald Marble: These small, perfectly-formed emerald marbles are crafted from the Spirit Seekers, who make their homes in the Isles of Wind and Fog. Often given as gifts to heroes who partake in world-protecting quests, more than one has been lost to the wilds. It’s said that if one looks deep within the marble, the spirits of the dead may be spoken to. Such practices are highly discouraged, since the eyes are the window to one’s soul, and the spirits may latch onto you. The marble’s more notable ability is to steal a recently lost soul from Death’s icy grip and draw it back into a body. If the left eye is plucked from a still-warm corpse, and replaced with the marble, it is said they’ll return from Death’s embrace
Deck of Detection: Each card in the deck is attuned to detect something different (traps, magic, forgery, etc). When a match is found, the card will teleport onto the object (up to 20').
Diadem of Illusion (permanent Blur spell, and can cast Mirror Image up to 3 times per day); platinum set with three stones (ruby, emerald, sapphire)
Digging Spoon: This tiny spoon can dig through any substance with a forceful push
Diminutive Golem of Trap Finding: This tiny kobold-shaped golem, when placed on the ground, acts like a wind-up toy: it moves straight ahead until it hits a wall or other obstacle, then stops. However, if there’s a trap between its starting point and the wall, it’ll studiously avoid it. It won’t react to traps triggered by something other than walking by them (such as opening a door)
Disc of Absorptive Negation: absorbs one spell that you dispel when holding the disc, stores for use within 24 hours
Diving Pearl: If a target is named and the pearl dropped into a body of water it’ll sink and move towards the target and latch onto it, returning it to the pearl’s owner. The pearl cannot move objects larger than a person
Dogpack Tooth: Pressed into someone’s gums, this tooth will take root and allow the owner to speak with dogs and wolves
Door Spikes: These appear to be ordinary metal spikes. When pounded into a solid surface, a door will spring into being beside the spike, leading through the surface, however thick it may be. The spike then loses its magical properties, but is still spiked into the doorjamb, preventing it from being opened until the spike is removed
Dragonhelm of Fearsome Brilliance: This a terribly impressive-looking helmet, shaped like a dragon’s head with the jaw wide open, in the process of devouring the wearer. The effects are minor, but thematic. If the wearer growls or shouts, he or she is backlighted in a lurid red light that can be easily seen across the battlefield. This can serve as a beacon for rallies, and gives some minor bonuses to intimidate … Of course, there’s a downside. The crafter neglected to cast any lightening enchantments. That ornately-decorate dragon’s head? It’s all steel – thick, heavy steel. Anyone who wears the helm regularly is guaranteed to get neck strain and recurrent lower back problems. Also, a solid hit on the helmet tends to snap the wearer’s neck
Drunken Javelin: This magical javelin never fails to strike its target when thrown. Unfortunately, the javelin chooses a random target within throwing range after it leaves the thrower’s hand. It can even curve back around to strike the thrower
Dustbane Broom: This broom not only brushes away dust, twigs and other leavings, but removes them from existence. This cannot be used to destroy other unwanted items, only things that would normally be swept up
Dwarven Identification Device: This is a small iron box inset with a viewing hole and a single button. By peering through the hole at a target and pressing the button, a small pointer attached to the machinery on the inside of the device will move to indicate whether or not the targeted creature or object is a Dwarf. The device provides no additional information beyond that, though it does pierce illusions, polymorph, invisibility, and similar effects in determining the Dwarf/Non-Dwarf status of the target
Earring of Enhanced Perception (+2 on all perception checks); gold hoop 
Earring of Speaking with the Dead
Earsplitting stone: As an action you can throw this small stone 60 feet. Creatures within 5 feet of the stone must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become deafened for 1 minute. Creatures who fail this saving throw can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the deafened condition on a successful save. You must complete a long rest before using this ability again.
Elephant Bread: This grey bread tastes faintly meaty and is incredibly filling
Enchanted Luggage: An autonomously mobile, indestructible chest of effectively infinite capacity, which will obey simple instructions, often poorly. For example, if you forget to tell it to stop walking it may walk right into a river or off a cliff
Engraving Quill: This quill can engrave messages onto any substance
Eternal Chessboard: Anyone playing chess with this set cannot win or lose a match. It simply goes on and on no matter how many moves the players take
Ether Flute: Playing this flute causes any ghosts or spirits to freeze, mesmerized
Ever-full Bag of Gold: This stout sack is always full to the brim with gold coins. It’s impossible to remove coins from the bag by any means
Figurine of Cat Summoning: A cat-shaped figurine that summons 1d6 normal house cats. It allows no control over the animals. They’ll do what cats normally do (determine if you have any food to offer them, and if not, they’ll all bugger off)
Fingerless Gloves: Whoever dons these gloves feels a faint tingling in their fingers. An hour later, it’ll be uncomfortable cramps. Another hour … intense pain. By now, if the gloves are removed, their fingers will magically vanish
Firey Ring: A container of food or liquid held in the hand that bears this ring will begin to boil within a minute, but the container will still be safe to hold
Fisherman’s Blanket: This blanket will become dry with a quick shake, regardless of how wet it is, and is always faintly warm
Fishing lure that gives +3 chance to catch a fish 
Flask of Snakes: When this flask is uncapped, several wild snakes of various species will swarm out. Though magically conjured, for all other purposes these snakes are ordinary. They vanish after a few minutes. Any bites they deliver are real and don’t vanish with the snakes; however, such wounds are not envenomed, even if the species is normally poisonous. The flask’s ability is repeatable, though it can produce no additional snakes until all existing ones have vanished

Gem of Evil Detection: Normally a cloudy white color, this stone will gradually turn black as evil approaches
Ghostly Shawl: When worn, this garment causes the wearer to take on a faded, apparition or ghost-like appearance. It bestows no other powers.

Gloves of the Pickpocket: A pair fingerless fine wool gloves dyed grey. When you’re wearing a pair of Gloves of the Pickpocket and have a small trinket in your hands – a coin, shiv, ring, or some such item – and gently rub your hands together, the trinket transforms into a small patch sewn onto the glove. The small patch vaguely resembles the original. When you spend a minute or so carefully removing one of the sewn patches, the patch reverts to the original trinket. Each glove has room for three patches. A clever seamstress or seamster may be able to create and sew a patch onto the glove … who knows what might happen when that patch is removed
Gnomish Notably Omniscient Monocle of Accurate Scrying and Identification of Transmutations and Enchantments (GNOMASITE): A monocle which can identify magic items. Three times per day its wearer can to make a Spellcraft check, DC 15 + Item Level. If they pass, they learn the properties of the item and how to activate it, as though they’ve used an Identify spell on it.

Hairbrush of Fallen Locks: This ornate boar-bristle hairbrush has a bejeweled handle – upon further inspection the “jewels” are well-crafted ornate glass.

When all the imbued shorn hair is placed on a lock, that lock springs open and the hair loses its enchantment
Halaster the Master Caster’s Blaster of Faster Disaster: This device takes the form of a small firearm, resembling a very short arquebuss or a handgun with a widely flared mouth. It has no visible means of loading ammunition. When the trigger is pulled, it fires a major calamity from the end. This can take the form of planet-killer meteors, volcanic supercalderas, fatal airborne cross-species plagues, interdimensional invasions by relentless unstoppable killing machines, and other fun ways to wreck your planet and possibly end civilization or life as you know it. (The DM may roll on Appendix 22-C.4, the Random Catastrophe Table, or pick as appropriate.) Anyone firing it, and anyone within several dozen miles, is guaranteed swift, certain death immediately upon use. It’s only been fired once, causing the Spellplague, which is about as mild it gets

Hold of Bagging: This item is, in fact, a stone fortress of moderate size, and thus completely non-portable. Anyone attempting to exit the fortress while carrying a load of loose items, either in their arms or in a wagon or other transport, will find that the items have been bundled up and placed in bags made of a thin but surprisingly tough white substance that weighs next to nothing. While handy when looting the keep, sometimes, it does a good job of bagging things up, and other times it places the gold bullion on top of the glass potion bottles. The hold itself appears to have the ruins of an ancient marketplace within its courtyard

Horrid mirror: Whenever any creature looks into this hand mirror, it sees a zombified version of itself.

Jellied Eyes: This small sealed glass jar contains the boiled and preserved eyes of some unfortunate person. Upon opening the jar, a whispered gasp can be heard, and the sweet smell of sugary decay is immediately evident.

Kingsblood Weed: Boiling this weed produces tea that will taste delicious to anyone of royal blood, but foul to anyone that isn’t

The robe can be damaged normally by all other means, so it can be disintegrated, burned, and so forth
Lampshade of Furnishing: When this lampshade is placed on the head of a being who is unmoving, it acts as a polymorph spell, transforming them into a random piece of furniture, usually one that’s out of place. Useful for hiding

Life Eating Sapphire: Whenever anyone holding this sapphire in one hand kills another being of above animal-level intelligence it glows and swells, increasing its value by 5%

Lockjam Key: This key will jam any lock in which it has been inserted and turned
Longstride Breeches: Anyone wearing these red breeches will never become tired from walking
Lover’s Binding Blade: Upon even the most detailed inspection, this sword looks as though it has never seen use. The blade is never scuffed or marred. When the sword’s command word is spoken while parrying an opponent’s weapon, the two weapons will instantly become stuck together in the position in which they contacted one another. Either party can pull the bound pair of weapons from the other’s grasp. The pair of weapons is still usable, though often impractically awkward. While the conflict continues, neither weapon can be dislodged from the other. Only after the full conclusion of the conflict will the two weapons separate again. Some such weapons remain bound for decades or even centuries while a great war smolders to its end
Madman’s Blanket: Anyone sleeping under this blanket will have horrible, maddening nightmares

Marvelous Unseen Warhammer: This is an ordinary warhammer, but fully invisible. It can’t be seen by any creature nor by any enchantment. Splashing the weapon with paint and similar ploys to reveal it are useless, as the paint also becomes invisible. You could still make a mold of the warhammer in mud or clay, though until separated from the weapon the mold too becomes invisible. Being invisible, even to the wielder, the weapon is difficult to use effectively
Mask of the Bell Tower: Upon donning this leather mask, the wearer’s visage changes to the likes of which only ever uttered in tales of horror. The wearer’s charisma score is immediately reduced to 3 (this doesn’t count as damage, the new stat simply replaces the old), however the wearer is now immune to charisma-based stat damage.

Once removed, the wearer’s Charisma stat returns to normal

Whenever this occurs, the amulet grows cold and slowly warms over the next few minutes
Money Belt: Any amount of money may be pressed into a small slot on the front of this belt. The money can be retrieved by tapping it three times and announcing how much is needed. This will even cause larger coins to be converted into change for specific amounts

Moon Ink: Anything written is invisible except in moonlight
Moon Rock: This rock has a strange feeling and is a weird yellow-grey colour. Any inspection suggests magical properties but in fact it’s completely mundane
Movable Rod: It’s like an Immovable Rod, except that it can only just support its own weight, i.e. like an IR it can be fixed in place/midair, but can be freely moved with any application of force. So technically it’s not even useful as a coathanger

Occum’s Razor: With a straight edge that seems to never dull, Occum’s Razor is perfect for a clean shave. But its true value lies in its ability to discern truth. When you spill blood with the razor onto a written question (in paper, stone, or anything else) the spilled blood will spell out an answer to the question. After the razor has been used in this way, the blade rusts and must be sharpened. Occum’s Razor refuses to be sharpened except on the bones of philosopher who has been dead for no more than an hour

Phantom Armor: This appears to be a full suit of armor with a misty, ethereal, almost insubstantial appearance. The armor makes no noise, and when carried, seems to weigh nothing. When worn, the armor offers no protection at all against most threats. Instead, the armor provides its full protection against attacks from insubstantial undead that normally bypass armor
Phylactery of Remembrance: This small leather box, adorned with a simple sigil, contains an ancient vellum scroll with indecipherable writing. It’s rumored to have been created by an ancient cult devoted to the collection of knowledge. When you acquire the Phylactery of Remembrance, the next time you cast a spell time freezes for a moment for everyone but you. An ancient forgotten entity appears in a vision demanding an answer to its question. Once you answer, the phylactery vanishes, and time immediately thaws

Pitcher of Dorian Grey: Any alcoholic liquid placed in this elegant crystal-ware jug ages at twice the normal rate. The owner of the Jug (Designated as the last to pour an alcoholic liquid inside) ceases aging so long as the pitcher remains within five feet of them. If the delicate crystal is shattered, all the extra years accumulated within the pitcher immediately reapply themselves to the owner
Porcelain Pig of Prosperity: This poorly painted porcelain pig figurine appears to be the work of an artistically disinclined student. When you place a single coin in the pigs small slotted mouth and leave it there until the next sunrise, two coins exactly like the original can be found in the pigs slotted rump. The coin in the pigs mouth is gone. When you gently polish the pig and gleefully mutter the phrase “Give me, give me! Pork, pork! Now! Now! Now!” the porcelain pig grows and permanently transforms into a succulent, aromatic, roasted hog large enough to feed 30 people. Inside the roasted hogs intestine can always be found a new Porcelain Pig of Prosperity

Ring of Free Movement (immune to paralysis, web, etc); three braided bands of silver, gold, and platinum
Ring of Ice: A ring crafted from unmelting, but decidedly cold, ice. You cannot perform any task requiring fine finger dexterity with the hand it’s worn on as the cold spreads from your finger, over your hand, up your arm, and can soon enough even be felt in your heart, though only your hand goes numb and shivering. While wearing it, however, you face no danger from extreme temperatures – you don’t even feel them; only the ring’s chill. It gives you the ability to encase a creature or object you stare at in ice
Ring of Regeneration: A tattered bronze ring with etchings worn beyond recognition. When wearing the Ring of Regeneration, and you gain a physical debility (e.g. Weak, Shaky, Sick), the debility fades within an hour or two.

Ring of Spell Turning: A shiny platinum band inlaid with a golden ring. The only hint of its magical nature is that the ring never tarnishes and always remains unmarred. While wearing it, any spells that would affect only you either rebound on the caster or affect both you and the caster, but at half potency

Rod of Lordly Fright: This is the most terrifying stick you’ve ever seen. You can barely stand to look at it. Even thinking about it sitting in your backpack gives you a case of the heebie-jeebies. If you can get over it, you might be able to find a use for tactical deployment of the willies
Rubber Duckie of Protection: Its owner will float without effort on water and aquatic predators will ignore them as long as they don’t try to attack them
Ruby Bracer: If you pantomime preparing an arrow, the Bracer will draw blood from whichever forearm it is worn upon. Doing this costs some amount of HP (let’s say 10). The arrow crystallizes and is fired as a normal arrow is. On hit it heals you for 15 HP (The original cost + 50%). The damage of the Blood Arrows would be higher than that of a regular Bow, the only problem being it slowly kills you if you miss

Sanguine Mask: This partial black mask with crimson red cheeks would cover your eyebrows down to your cheekbones. When touched, the color transforms to your skin tone. When donned, the mask seamlessly fuses to your face; only your ruddy cheeks betoken its presence. So long as you’ve drunk nothing alcoholic in the past day, you may remove the mask. With the Sanguine Mask on, you are (if uninjured) better at carousing, but worse at melee fighting; if injured while wearing it, you become better at melee fighting. If you fall asleep before engaging in melee since you last slept, upon waking the Sanguine Mask is gone, and you have dozens of minor facial cuts; you look frightening until these heal
Sap spigot: As an action you can drive this spigot into a tree and it pours forth 1d10 cups of nutritious sap. 1 cup of sap is enough to feed a Medium or Small creature for 1 day.

Anything passing into this area is replaced by an illusion of that thing’s true, natural form. Disguised and polymorphed creatures are depicted as they truly are. Illusory and other “fake” creatures/objects vanish entirely. Invisible creatures are made visible. All are naked. The projected illusion lacks any and all equipment, clothing, and other worn objects. Everyone within the orb’s radius still has all their clothing/equipment and still has the capabilities/restrictions and size/dimensions of their current form, these things are just not shown. For example, a man who has been polymorphed into a chair is shown by the orb as naked, sitting motionless on the ground

Also, the blood it steadily drips burns like oil in the moonlight. While the nail is buried in your flesh you’re immune to mind-affecting enchantments and can see through illusions and glamours
Sword of Yodeling: This sword appears to be a potent weapon. It glows, and will radiate magic when Detect Magic is cast upon it. It’s intelligent, but cannot communicate with its wielder, and confers no bonus to hit, or damage.

Tasha’s megaphone: While holding this megaphone as an action you can cast Tasha’s hideous laughter (spell save DC 13). You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest.
Teapot of Tea Time: A teapot that, each day at 4 PM, will whistle loudly and make piping hot tea … regardless of where it is (backpack, for instance). There’s no way to prevent this. It’s good tea though
The Blood Bow: Originally crafted for an ancient, unknown vampire lord, whose unlife was cut short by a travelling band of adventurers, this bow doesn’t use ammunition; instead, it uses the blood of its bearer to create its arrows
The Coin of Darkness: Any time the coin is not in a bag, pocket, or closed fist it produces a 20ft sphere of darkness
The Decanter of Endless Water
The Edge of Decay: Despite the awesome name, this is just an enchanted kitchen knife with a six-inch blade. When used to slice any food item, the food magically transmutes itself to a state of being ready to go bad. Bread becomes slightly stale; cheese, a touch moldy; vegetables limp, and meat slightly “off”. This is so whether the ingredient was fresh or a years-old, desiccated, moldy husk. The sliced food is always safe to eat, but never tasty. As a safety precaution, the knife’s enchantment has no effect on living beings. (Though it can be handy for confounding forensics in murder investigations.)
The Emperor’s Invisible Clothes: These very comfortable clothes are indestructible, but invisible. Despite rumors to the contrary, not even people qualified for their jobs can see them
The Fat Lute: This is a very large stringed instrument, heavy enough to be just barely luggable. Its deep, mellow tone is pleasing and resonant. If actively played the entire time from when you meet a foe to when you’ve defeated him, you’ll discover that his body was carrying far more treasure than you suspected. Similarly, if played from when you enter an area, any treasure later found here will also be miraculously multiplied several times over. It has no disadvantages, other than those which come with trying to convince a talented musician to keep playing an oversized, unwieldy instrument in the heat of battle
The Fifty-Foot Rope: This coil of hempen rope is fifty feet long. At every foot of its length, it has attached a life-sized woven replica of a human foot (alternating left and right). If laid out on the ground and commanded, the feet begin to march until told to stop. They’re capable of pulling whatever the rope is attached to with the force of twenty-five adult humans. Apart from replacing pack animals, it’s very handy for cheating at tug-of-war (if obvious when you do so). There also exists the Fifty-Foot Rope Trick, which is almost identical, but the feet march straight up, somehow finding solid footholds in empty air, and can’t be commanded to move along the ground instead
The Illithid Dagger: Inserting the blade into the brain of a host, living or dead, imparts the wielder with all knowledge obtained by the victim in his or her entire lifetime
The Magic Hat of Tisamenos the Vainglorious: Perhaps this odd accessory was the famed sorcerer’s idea of a joke upon would-be thieves. Perhaps it was some archaic prototype of the infamous Deck of Many Things. Perhaps it was simply a stylish portable hole wherein the sorcerer stored all his old junk, now taken on a mind of its own. In any event, one reaching into the hat may draw forth a duck, or perhaps a magical sabre, or a magical sabre-toothed duck. There’s only one way to find out
The Map of the Lost Patrol: An ancient order of brave rangers once patrolled the land, protecting villages and warning kings and queens of encroaching danger. They’re long gone, now, but their legacy remains. This map, when marked with the blood of a group of people, will always show their location—so long as they remain within the bounds of the map
The Rings of Theremin: A pair of magical rings which function exactly as a theremin (one hand controlled volume, the other pitch)
The Treeform Cloak: Allows the wearer to, once per day, turn into a tree on command
The Vile Vial: This glass container radiates magic, and appears to contain a potion. Upon sampling, it tastes so disgusting, the taster must make a saving throw to avoid vomiting. (The liquid turns out to be ordinary water, affected by the vial’s magic.) Any liquid stored within instantly and irrevocably becomes undrinkable, with the most foul, disgusting flavor imaginable – yet, being odorless, cannot be distinguished by any means other than its horrific taste
Thilvertongue Broach: An attempt at creating a Silvertongue Broach gone wrong, this causes the wearer to speak with a heavy lisp. The item cannot be removed without Remove Curse or Wish
Thunderous Pendant: When worn as part of a necklace, the volume of the wearer’s voice is greatly amplified. Only by removing the necklace will the wearer’s voice cease to be booming and thunderous
Timepiece of Death Prediction: This timepiece will give you the exact time of your death … 6 seconds in advance
Timunn’s Armor: A stealthy suit of armor, it appears as many things to many people and blends in with appropriate apparel. The wearer always seems the height of fashion to any who gaze upon him
Tiny Everburning Candle: a tiny candle that can never be extinguished. Can never be stowed away as its flame could light up a standard backpack. Also great for birthday cakes when playing tricks
Toematoes: the wearer’s toes double in size, making it impossible to wear most footwear
Tower Shield of the Mighty Wall: When the wearer speaks the command word inscribed on this tower shield, the shield will change into a concrete wall of variable dimensions. Initially two feet thick, this wall will expand to block off the passage or room, growing at most to 10×10 feet. While this wall is deployed, the wearer remains stuck in place with his/her arm submerged in the wall. If the wearer is dislodged from the wall, it morphs back into a tower shield. The wearer can otherwise revert it by speaking the command word again
Traveller’s Fork: The Traveller’s Fork is a simple two-tined wooden fork. When the fork is burnt at a road intersection, and you point down one path and speak a creature’s name, that creature is compelled to avoid that path until the next sunset
Trolltop Desk: No matter how many kids carve “Harley Davidson 4 EVER” or “Sandy <3 Johnny” onto this desk, it’ll return to its original smoothness. Vulnerable to fire and acid damage
Truly portable ram: This portable ram weighs 1/2 lb. and as an action can be folded into a 6-inch cube. Another action is required to unfold the ram for use.
Unassuming Pouch of the Kender: This pouch appears to be a normal leather pouch, not detectable as magical. But every 2d4 hours, one item within a radius of 20′ magically ends up inside the pouch. Items sent to the pouch this way don’t add to its weight, so few pouch owners are aware that other people’s property might currently be in their possession. To date, the majority of this pouch’s owners have either been sent to prison or killed outright, usually over their protestations of innocence. However, should the pouch’s owner know of its properties, the magical key line, “Oh, I found this. You must’ve dropped it.” will psychically allay any suspicions of the pouch owner
Urgent ram: This portable ram provides a +6 bonus on Strength checks made to break down doors.
Vest of feather fall: As a reaction you can cast feather fall, but it only effects you. You must complete a short rest before you use this ability again.
Wand of Winder: A thin metal rod about a foot in length, it has a pair of large, flat, butterfly-like loops at one end, and the other end of the rod has a slot cut across it. If touched to any mechanical device, you can power the device by turning the wand around its axis
Warming Spoon: Any food scooped up by this spoon will be warmed to the ideal temperature for consumption
Warming vest: If you place this vest in a large fire (such as a campfire or fireplace fire) for at least an hour, it retains the heat. For the next 12 hours any creature who wears the vest cannot gain levels of exhaustion from exposure to the cold. The heat disappears from the vest 12 hour after being removed from the fire.
Wayfinder: a magical compass
Webbed Pipes: These enlarged brass musical pipes seem perpetually infested with all kinds of spiders and their nests. The pipes always seem to be in poor condition and are unsuitable for playing. If blown with enough force, the pipes will project a mass of sticky webbing as per the Web spell over a short distance. This is always a winding and tiring work. Blowing into the pipes also causes the inhabitants to panic. The user risks being bitten about the hands, face, and mouth by the (occasionally poisonous) spiders
Will-O-Wisp Lantern: This plain brass lantern has a large open face and a stub of candle within. Engraved on its worn handle is a single word in dwarvish, flanked by unusual runes. When held aloft and the word is spoken, the lamp ignites with a bright light equivalent to several torches. The candle inside the lantern neither ‘burns’ nor gives off heat, and its ghostly, white-blue light lasts until the engraved word is spoken again.<br/>Especially amazing is that, once lit, the lantern will hover in place when released; if the speaker moves, the lantern will follow at a leisurely pace, hovering and always remaining within 10 feet. Any weight more than that of a coin placed on the hovering lamp will cause it to descend, still lit, to the ground. Attempts to tie objects, or otherwise exploit the lantern’s levitation will fail.<br/>If anyone else besides whoever spoke the command word touches the lantern, it’ll immediately extinguish and crash to the ground, awaiting to be lit again by the magical word inscribed on it
Writ of Demeter: This vellum scroll’s exterior is often decorated with ancient and abstract symbols. When reading the scroll, and incanting a person’s name, until the next sunrise, the named person’s voice may only be heard by you and/or the people with whom he or she has a bond. Once read aloud, the Writ of Demeter turns to ash

Variant: Exploration Age Magic Item
Creation
If a DM allows players to craft permanent magic items in
their down time, at least half the cost of creating the item
must be paid in gems, which are incorporated into final
form of the item.
Aberrant Revolver of Comedy
Weapon (aberrant revolver), rare (requires
attunement)
This ivory and jade revolver has a barrel opening
shaped to look like a laughing face. When fired, the
revolver lets out a wild cackle. You gain a +1 bonus to
attack and damage rolls made with the revolver. When
you damage a creature with an Intelligence score of 5
or higher with the revolver you can choose to have the
revolver cast Tasha's hideous laughter on the creature
(save DC 15). The revolver cannot cast this spell again
until you complete a short or long rest.
Aberrant Revolver of Weakening
Weapon (aberrant revolver), very rare (requires
attunement)
This revolver is made of shining steel embedded with
lapis lazulis. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and
damage rolls made with the revolver. When you
damage a creature with the revolver you can choose to
force the creature to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw. If the creature fails, its melee attacks
deal only half damage for 1 minute. A creature who
fails this saving throw can repeat it at the end of its
turn, ending this effect on a success. You cannot use
this feature again until you complete a short or long
rest.
Aberrant Rifle of Webs
Weapon (aberrant rifle), very rare (requires
attunement)
This double-barreled aberrant rifle is made of black
steel embedded with spider web shaped tiger’s eye
gems. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this rifle. This rifle has 10 charges. As an
action you can expend a charge and shoot a magic web
as a ranged attack from the second barrel of the gun at
a creature who is no more than 30 feet away. A
creature hit by the web is restrained. The web has no
effect on creatures that are formless or creatures that
are Huge or larger. As an action, a creature can try
to free itself or another creature restrained by the web
with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Dealing 10
slashing damage to the web (AC 12) also frees the
creature without harming it, ending the effect. This
rifle regains 1d6+4 charges each day at dawn.
Angel’s Call
Weapon (halberd), legendary (requires attunement)
This halberd is plated with gold and silver images of
celestials and edged with diamond. When swung, a
hymn to a good god is heard and puffs of white smoke
are left in the path of the blade. You gain a +3 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with the halberd. As a
bonus action while holding angel's call you can make
the weapon shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and
dim light in another 30. You can use another bonus
action to make the weapon stop shedding light. While
holding the weapon you can use your action to cast
the conjure celestial spell. You cannot use angel's
call to cast the spell for 1d10 days after you use this
ability.
Asphyxiating Charge
Weapon (alchemical charge), rare
This alchemical charge is filled with a green liquid and
explodes on impact releasing poison gas in a 30-footradius.
Creatures in the effected area must make a DC
15 Constituion saving throw. Creatures who fail take
4d6 poison damage and are poisoned for 1 minute.
Creatures who succeed take half damage and are not
poisoned. Creatures who fail this saving throw can
repeat it at the end of its turn, ending the poisoned
condition on a success.
Bell Ringer
Weapon (maul), very rare (requires attunement)
This maul sports an adamantine shaft and a glassteel
head studded with rubies arranged in the shaped of a
large bell. When enemies are struck with the weapon
the sound of a large alarm bell being rung is heard
coming from the great hammer. Attacks made with a
bell ringer have a +1 bonus to attack and damage. The
maul deals an additional 1d6 thunder damage to
creatures you hit with it. As an action the maul can be
struck against the ground or similarly hard surface to
create a wave of sonic destruction. All creatures with
20 feet of you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw. Creatures who fail take 4d8 thunder damage
and are knocked prone. Creatures who succeed take
half damage and are not knocked prone. You must
complete a long rest before you can use this ability
again.
Belt of Hidden Knives
Wondrous item, rare
This appears to be a simple, unassuming black leather
belt when wrapped around the user’s waist. When
removed, a small diamond can be seen stitched into
the belt’s underside. Each time this belt is buckled, it
sounds like a sword being drawn from a sheath. As
part of an attack, you can draw a hidden +1
dagger from the belt of hidden knives. If the dagger
leaves your hands it ceases to exist at the end of your
turn. The belt does not run out of daggers. You must
be wearing the belt to use this property.
Belt of the Monkey
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
This metal belt is made of silver monkeys locked arm
in arm with tiny pieces of jade for each primate’s eyes.
While wearing it, you feel the tickling urge to treat the
world as a playground and swing on objects and climb
trees and buildings. While wearing this belt you add
double your proficiency to Strength (Athletics) checks
to climb.
As an action any tail you have becomes prehensile
for an hour. If you do not have a tail, you grow a 3-
foot prehensile tail out of your posterior for an hour.
You can hang from your tail, provided it has
something to hold onto. Your tail also acts as a third 
James Introcaso
worldbuilderblog.me
arm and hand, allowing you to manipulate and wield
objects that weigh 5 lbs. or less. In this state you
could hold three weapons at once, but you can still
only fight with two at a time. You cannot use this
ability again until you have completed a long rest.
Belt of the Scorpion
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
The belt of the scorpion is a piece of mithral chain
held together by a padlock with a single, large emerald
at its center. When the belt is within 10 feet of an
arachnid, a faint light flickers within the
emerald. While wearing this belt you have resistance
to poison damage and advantage on saving throws
against poison. While wearing the belt of the scorpion,
as an action you can make a scorpion-like mithral tail
grow from the back of the belt. The tail is a light,
finesse, martial weapon which deals 1d6 piercing
damage and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage
rolls.
When you deal damage to a target with this attack,
you may choose to inject it with venom. The target
must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or
become paralyzed for one minute. You must complete
a long rest before you can use this feature again.
Bomb of Horrors
Weapon (bomb), rare
This bomb looks like a screaming skull and has two
red zircons for eyes. All creatures who are in the zone
of the bomb's blast must make a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or be frightened of you for 1
minute. Creatures who fail this saving throw can
repeat it at the end of its turn, ending the
frightened condition on a success.
Bomb of Silence
Weapon (bomb), uncommon
This bomb has a single purple zircon on its bottom.
When the bomb explodes it makes no sound. After the
bomb explodes all sounds are magically silenced in
the zone of its blast for 1 minute.
Boomeraxe
Weapon (handaxe), very rare (requires attunement)
This small handaxe sports a double-bladed adamantine
head at either end of its jade-studded steel haft. You
gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls while
wielding the handaxe. It magically returns to your
hand when thrown. In addition, three times per
day you can use your action to fly the handaxe in a 60-
foot line. Each creature in the line must make a
Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Strength
modifier + your proficiency bonus). Creatures who fail
the saving throw take 6d6 slashing damage, creatures
who succeed take half damage. At the start of your
next turn the boomeraxe returns to the space you
originally threw it along the same line it left. Creatures
in that line must make the same saving throw or suffer
the same effect as when you released the handaxe. If
you are standing along the line or in the spot where
you threw the boomeraxe and have a free hand you
may catch it.
Boots of the Wild
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These are special boots of animal skin, each dotted
with a tiny gem on the sole. The boots usually lace up
to the knee, and are found in several varieties of
animal skin – from deer to lizard. While wearing the
boots add 5 feet to your speed. In addition, use the
chart below to determine the type of difficult terrain
you can ignore while wearing the boots of the wild.
Types of boots of the wild
Skin Difficult Terrain(s) Ignored
Lizard Jungle, marsh, swamp
Deer Forest
Ram Mountains
Reindeer Ice, snow
Bow of Grounding
Weapon (longbow), rare (requires attunement)
A stiff but bendable chain makes up the curvature of
this longbow. Each link of chain has a small pink pearl
in the center. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and
damage roll made with this longbow. When you shoot
a creature with a fly speed with the bow of
grounding it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or have its fly speed reduced by 10 feet.
The target must complete a short rest before it can
regain any fly speed lost in this way.
Box of Shrinking
Wondrous item, rarity varies
These plain boxes are carved with Dwarvish runes,
surprisingly light, and roughly the size of a loaf of
bread. Inside, the box is much more extravagant, lined
with crushed velvet and studded with gems. An old
dwarf nursery rhyme plays when the box is open –
“The Legend of Calibra Daliq,” a dwarf wizard thief,
who shrunk herself to sneak past guards and locked
doors in order to get her riches.
The DM either rolls to determine the box’s type or
chooses one from the options available.
Types of boxes of shrinking
d100 Metal Original Object SpaceRarity
01 - 50 Iron 5-foot cube or smaller Common
51 - 80 Steel 10-foot cube or smaller Rare
81 - 95 Mithral 15-foot cube or smaller Rare
96 - 00 Adamantine 20-foot cube or smaller Very Rare
You can use the box of shrinking’s Grow and
Shrink abilities once per day each. You must be
holding the box to use either ability.
Grow. As an action, any item previously shrunken
by a box of shrinking of equal or lesser rarity and
power may be grown. The item must be placed in the
box of shrinking and its original size must be within
the parameters on the table above. Once the command
word is spoken the object appears in an unoccupied
space adjacent to the box of shrinking. You must be
holding the box of shrinking to use this ability.
James Introcaso
worldbuilderblog.me
Shrink. As an action you may speak a
command word and one non-living object within 50
feet of the box of shrinking has its size reduced to a 1-
inch cube, weighs half a pound, and is teleported into
the box. The item stays this size until it is grown by
a box of shrinking. The shrunken item may be no
larger than specified on the table above.
Bracelet of Seduction
Wondrous item, rare
Some merchants have these charm bracelets specially
made, so they might avoid trouble during their travels.
The bracelet is well made, a silver chain with small
silver heart charms hanging off each link. A single one
of these charms is carved from a rose zircon, which
gives off a small amount of heat when the
bracelet’s magic is activated. While wearing the
bracelet, three times per day you may use charm
person (save DC 15). You must be touching the target
in order to use this magic.
Breast Plate of Chaos
Armor (breast plate), very rare (requires attunement)
This breast plate has a large rainbow-colored diamond
in the middle of its chest. As an action you can
command this diamond to shine bright light in a 20-
foot radius and dim light another 10 after that.
Using another action you can deactivate the light. You
gain a +2 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.
While you are wearing this armor as a reaction to
being hit with an attack you can roll on the Wild
Magic Surge table (pg 104 of the Player's Handbook),
ignoring and re-rolling a result of 99 - 100. The spell
save DC for any spells cast this way is 15. Once you
have used this ability two times you cannot use it
again until you complete a long rest.
Cheater’s Gloves
Wondrous item, uncommon
These fine white gloves of a gentlemen or elbow
length gloves of a lady were invented by the classiest
of thieves. Each glove fastens with a single, diamondstudded
button. While wearing them, you have an
itching urge to palm small, unattended objects. When
you use these gloves you have advantage when
making a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to steal an
item and when your character plays a game with cards
or dice.
Dagger of Banishing
Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement)
The jade hilt of this cold iron dagger features an image
of a solar banishing a pit fiend back to the Nine Hells.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
with the dagger. While holding the dagger you know
the precise location of any portals on the same plane
as you within 100 feet even if the portal is hidden or
inactive. When you hit a creature on a plane other than
the target’s home plane with the dagger you can force
the target to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If
the creature fails the saving throw it is banished to its
home plane and cannot return to the plane you are
currently on for 1d4 days. You cannot use this ability
again for the same number of days. When you use the
dagger’s banishment ability and the target fails the
saving throw you may choose to destroy the dagger.
The ensuing burst of magic power means the target
cannot return to the plane you are currently on for
10d10 years.
Exploding Bullet
Weapon (bullet), rare
This diamond dust flecked, lead ball sparkles in the
light. When handled it feels quite warm. When you
shoot the bullet it explodes on impact in a 20-footradius.
All creatures in the effected area must make a
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures who fail take
10d6 fire damage, creatures who save take half
damage.
Exploding Studded Leather
Armor (studded leather), rare (requires attunement)
This black leather armor is studded with deep orange
and red gemstones which drink in light. You gain a +1
bonus to AC while wearing this armor. While wearing
this armor you can cast fireball centered on yourself.
You do not take damage from this casting of the spell.
You cannot use this ability again until you complete a
long rest.
Face of Distraction
Armor (shield), very rare
A terrifying, sunken face grimaces on the front of the
black steel shield with eyes of onyx. This shield grants
the wielder a +2 bonus to AC. As a bonus action you
may cause the shield to shriek at an adjacent enemy.
The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or the next attack roll made against it before the
start of your next turn has advantage. You must
complete a short or long rest before you can use the
shriek ability again.
Fishscale Flippers
Wondrous item, rare
The flippers are crafted from green fish scales and
feature small sapphires on their heels. While wearing
these flippers, you can breathe underwater and gain a
swim speed equal to your current speed.
Flail of Force
Weapon (flail), legendary (requires attunement)
This flail has a clear glassteel head with a large
sapphire in the center. When touched the flail can be
felt subtly vibrating, as if it can barely contain its
power. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage
rolls with the flail. Each time you deal damage to a
Large or smaller creature it must succeed on a DC 15
Strength check or be pushed backwards 5 feet. While
holding the flail of force you can use your action to
spin the flail very quickly creating a small wall of
force per the spell adjacent to you. This wall is only 5
feet tall, 5 feet wide, and lasts 1 minute. You can only
create one wall this way at a time.
James Introcaso
worldbuilderblog.me
Flying Disc
Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)
This steel shield’s face is always bright and shiny. Dirt
and grime seem to simply fall off its surfaces and any
dings or dents received in battle disappear overnight.
The white angel wings emblazoned on its front are
always shining and Elvish runes are engraved in gold
and diamond around the shield’s perimeter. When
the flying disc is activated the letters move in a circular
motion around the shield and the wings begin
flapping. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wield
this shield. As an action, you throw the flying disc on
the ground and stand on top of it. Using the disc this
way allows it to carry you through the air and as a
result you gain a fly speed of 30 feet. You can use the
shield to fly up to 10 minutes each day, all at once or
in several shorter flights. Attempting to fly beyond that
time causes the magic to gradually fade, and you
descend at a rate of 10 feet per round until you land.
For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the flying
disc is not being flown, the shield regains 5 minutes of
flying. While using the shield to fly, it does not grant
you any bonus to AC.
Hands of the Craftsman
Wondrous item, uncommon
Hags invented these sturdy leather work gloves with a
cat’s eye on the back. They gave the hands of the
craftsman to artisans in exchange for the lives of their
children. Every time one puts on the gloves, they
experience the memory of a loved one they have
lost. When you wear the hands of the craftsman the
time it takes to create a nonmagical object is cut in
half and you need only pay a third of the material
costs to do so.
Healer’s Crossbow
Weapon (any crossbow), very rare (requires
attunement)
Made from the wood of yew trees charred by lighting
of the gods this heavy crossbow is studded with hearts
carved of rose zircon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack
and damage rolls made with the crossbow. You may
turn a bolt you shoot from the crossbow into a healing
bolt. When struck with a bolt the target takes damage
as normal and then heals a number of hit points equal
to 4d10 + 4. You cannot shoot another healing
bolt from the crossbow until you complete a short or
long rest.
Horseman’s Lance
Weapon (lance), rare
This lance’s adamantine shaft is studded with small
horses carved of black pearl. You gain a +1 bonus to
attack and damage rolls made with the lance. If you
attack with the lance while mounted and your mount
moves at least 30 feet before you attack your first
attack roll that round deals an additional 3d10 piercing
damage.
Icer
Weapon (aberrant rifle), very rare (requires
attunement)
This blue steel aberrant rifle is studded along its barrel
with icy sapphires. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and
damage rolls made with this rifle. This bonus rises to
+2 if you load the weapon with cold alchemical
charges. As an action you can expend a cold
alchemical charge loaded in the aberrant rifle to shoot
a 60-foot line of cold energy. Creatures in the line
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving. Creatures who
fail take 3d6 cold damage, creatures who succeed take
half.
As an action you can expend a cold alchemical
charge loaded in the aberrant rifle to coat a 5-foot by
5-foot area in a thin layer of ice. The ice lasts for 1
minute before melting, unless the area's temperature is
extremely cold, in which case it could last longer
(which is up to the DM). Creatures who enter the
effected area must make a DC 15 Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check or fall prone. If the ice is used to
coat over a door or doorway, a DC 15 Strength check
is required to break through the ice.
Iron Net
Weapon (net), uncommon
This black net is adorned with skulls carved of ruby
and shrieks when thrown. When you hit a target with
the net you speak a command word which turns the
net into a twisting iron cage for 1 hour. While
transformed this way the DC for the Strength check to
break free of the net rises to 18, the iron net has AC

making a Strength ability check contested
by the target's Strength or Dexterity
ability check (whichever is greater). If

cannot be made through solid rock or large trees. The
beetles move in a path and pace defined by you (or the

The Wubba Wubba
Wand, legendary (requires attunement by a nonlawful
spellcaster)
At a glance this wand appears to be a normal wand of
wonder but closer investigation reveals the
multicolored gems along its length spell out the
phrase, "Wubba Wubba," in Common.
The legend of The Wubba Wubba is known far and
wide, initially told and spread by epic poet Bob the
Bard who wielded one of the wands. Only three
were crafted before their creator, Michael the
Prankster, disappeared in a planar magic accident. The
item is both feared and sought after by scholars, for it
is ever unpredictable, but holds great power.
While attuned the caster has advantage on all
Charisma (Deception) checks and Charisma saving
throws. Unlike a normal wand, The Wubba Wubba has
unlimited charges.
Chaotic Magic. While holding the wand you can use
an action to target a creature within 60 feet, shout,
“Wubba wubba!” and then roll 1d8 and 1d20 on the
tables below. The d8 corresponds to the first table,
Schools of Magic, while the d20 corresponds to the
table indicated by the first table. The Wubba Wubba
uses your spellcasting ability modifier, spell save DC,
and spellcasting attack bonus. The Wubba Wubba can
only maintain the magic of one concentration spell at a
time.
Sentience. The Wubba Wubba is a sentient chaotic
neutral wand with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of
10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and
darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
The weapon can speak, read, and understand
Common, and can communicate with its wielder
telepathically. Its voice is energetic and cartoony.
While you are attuned to it, The Wubba Wubba also
understands every language you know.
Personality. The Wubba Wubba exists to have a great
time. It cracks bawdy jokes and then laughs out loud
at itself. It encourages its wielder to prank friends,
engage in revelry, and above all use the wand's
Chaotic Magic feature as often as possible.
If the wielder is a true partier and friend to The Wubba
Wubba, the wand will fiercely defend the wielder from
any japes or cutting remarks. The Wubba Wubba is
quick to judge and if it doesn't like someone that
person will certainly know it, since the wand doesn't
keep its mouth shut. The wand does not suffer bullies
of any kind and has no respect for authority.
The wand has an irrational fear of spiders. Any size
spider within the wand's sight causes the wand to howl
in fear like a small child. In battle with arachnid
foes The Wubba Wubba prefers its wielder to keep a
healthy distance away but cheers with delight when all
enemies are vanquished.

Bioarcane Items
The strange race of humanoids who lived in The
Damned Lands before it became a wasteland, left
behind a strange technology compatible with the
anatomy of today's humanoids.
The magic of these items is unlocked only by
attaching them to one's body. This requires a limb or
organ be removed before the item is grafted to the
owner in its place.
During a short or long rest (specified in the item's
description), another creature can perform the
procedure of removing your body part or organ
and attaching the item to you with a DC 10 Wisdom
(Medicine) check. If you decide to perform the
procedure on yourself the DC of the check is 15. If the
check succeeds the item is attached and you take 3d6
damage that cannot be reduced in any way. If the
check is fails by 4 or less, the item is attached but you
take 8d6 damage that cannot be reduced in any way. If
the check is failed by 5 or more, you lose the organ or
body part, the item is not attached, and you take 16d6
damage which cannot be reduced in any way. In
special cases noted in the item's description failure to
attach the bioarcane item results in your death. Once
the item is attached, it is activated and you can begin
to make use of its properties.
Blade Skin
Bioarcane item, legendary (requires attunement)
A first blush, blade skin appears to be a ragged pile of
cloth and metal with strange designs in sapphires and
diamonds. When handled, blade skin is warm to the
touch and calls to the user the way a shell would to a
hermit crab. Once inspected thoroughly the truth is
learned; this is a second skin which the wearer can
affix to his or her body. With the skin attached, you
are intimidating indeed, for it is covered in creative
scars incorporated with the gems which tell the tale of
a famous tavern brawl over the wearer’s entire body.
When the metal weapons are not retracted, the user is
covered from head to toe in sharp adamantine blades.
You must remove all the skin on your body and
replace it with the blade skin. This can only be done
during a long rest. The Wisdom (Medicine) check DC
for this attachment procedure increases by 5 and if the
check fails by 5 or more, you die. While
wearing blade skin, hidden, retractable blades lie in
wait for enemies just beneath the skin’s surface. When
you take damage from an adjacent creature’s melee
attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6+3
piercing damage to attacker. You may also use your
reaction to deal this damage to any creature who is
grappling with you on its turn.
With the skin attached your unarmed attacks can be
light, finesse, melee attacks in which you are
proficient. This attack deals 1d6 piercing damage. You
gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this
attack.
With the skin attached you have advantage when
making a Strength (Athletics) check to climb.
Hawk’s Eye
Bioarcane item, uncommon (requires attunement)
An eye carved of pure jade, the hawk’s eye is true to
its name and has the appearance and shape of a bird’s
eye. Once installed, the eye gives off a slight green
glow. You must remove one of your eyes and replace
it with the hawk’s eye. This can be done during a short
or long rest. Once attached, you gain advantage on all
Wisdom (Perception) checks when attempting to spot
hidden creatures or objects. In addition, you gain a +2
bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score.
Jumpers
Bioarcane item, rare (requires attunement)
This pair of mithral legs have knees which bend in a
direction opposite that of a human, similar to a bird.
The bottoms of the feet each sport a large emerald and
the calves and thighs are carved with ancient runes
which glow blue when the user walks and green when
he or she runs or jumps. You must remove both of
your legs and replace them with the jumpers. This can
be done only during a long rest. Once attached, you
are always considered to have moved 10 feet before
any jump you make, even if you have not. In addition,
whenever you jump, you leap four times the normal
distance.
Mage’s Eye
Bioarcane item, legendary (requires attunement)
This is an eye carved of a fiery opal, and a
disembodied mage’s eye seems to follow onlookers as
they walk. When attached, the eye glows red in the
socket and gives off a slight physical heat. You must
remove one of your eyes and replace it with
the mage’s eye. This can be done during a short or
long rest. Once attached, you gain true sight out to 120
feet.

Radiant Heart
Bioarcane item, very rare (requires attunement)
The radiant heart is an expertly carved, heart-shaped
ruby placed in a small brass box with windows of
glassteel. When attached, the gem can be seen through
the window inside the users chest, throbbing and
beating with the life of a real heart. You must remove
your heart and replace it with the radiant heart. This
can only be done during a long rest. The Wisdom
(Medicine) check DC for this attachment procedure
increases by 5 and if the check fails by 5 or more, you
die. Once attached, you can use your action to shoot a
beam of radiant light in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet
wide from your chest. Creatures in the line must make
a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your Charisma
modifier + your proficiency bonus). Creatures who fail
the save take 8d8 radiant damage, creatures who
succeed take half damage. Against fiends and undead,
the beam deals 8d10 radiant damage. You must
complete a short rest before you can use this ability
again.
Silver Fangs
Bioarcane item, rare (requires attunement)
This set of four large, silver canines, has a small
sapphire set into the back of each tooth. On the front
of the tooth is a small rune, which glows red when the
teeth are being used to attack or eat meat. When you
attach the fangs, your appetite for meat borders on
insatiable. You must remove your canines and replace
them with the silver fangs. This can be done during a
short or long rest. Once attached, you gain a bite
attack which counts as an attack with a light, finesse,
silver melee weapon in which you are proficient. This
attack deals 1d4 piercing damage. You gain a +1
bonus to attack and damage rolls with this attack. If
you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this attack,
you heal 1d4 + 2 hit points.
Sonic Fist
Bioarcane item, very rare (requires attunement)
The sonic fist appears to be a sculpture of an obsidian
hand with diamond-studded knuckles curled into a fist.
However, when a creature handles the disembodied
hand, it flexes its fingers before once again bringing
them into the fist. When attached, the hand begins a
low chant in combat. This seems to be a sort of hymn
in a strange language which grows louder and louder
as the fight progresses. You must remove one of your
hands and replace it with the sonic fist. This can be
done during a short or long rest. Once attached, the fist
is a light, finesse melee weapon in which you are
proficient. It deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage and 1d6
sonic damage. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and
damage rolls with the sonic fist.
With the sonic fist attached you can use your action
to create a 30-foot cone of sound. All creatures in the
cone must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 +
your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus).
Creatures who fail the save take 6d8 sonic damage and
are deafened for one minute. Creatures who succeed
take only half damage and are not deafened. You
cannot use this ability again until you have completed
a long rest.
Tongue of Contentment
Bioarcane item, rare (requires attunement)
This disembodied black tongue is studded with rubies
and warm to the touch. It twitches as if it were still
alive. It is believed the tongue of contentment was
invented by whatever strange race lived within The
Damned Lands to prevent folk from starving on long
journeys. You must remove your own tongue and
replace it with the tongue of contentment. This process
can be done during a short or long rest. Once attached,
you don't need to eat or drink.
Wrist Spider
Bioarcane item, rare (requires attunement)
This small device has the appearance of an adamantine
spider with eight onyx eyes. It is inserted into the top
of the wrist, with the abdomen of the spider facing the
user’s hands. After the item is attached, you feel most
comfortable in the darkened corners of rooms. You
must remove your wrist bones and replace them with
the wrist spider. This can only be done during long
rest. Once attached, you can use your action to shoot
sticky webs out of your wrists at enemies. To do so
make an attack roll using your Dexterity modifier and
proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, the target is
restrained for one minute. On the target’s turn, it can
make a DC 12 Strength or Dexterity saving throw as
its move to end the restrained condition. You cannot
use this ability again until you complete a short rest.
With the wrist spider attached you can use your
action to create a 50-foot length of rope made of the
web. The rope is only slightly sticky along its length
and extremely sticky at its ends. Because of the
stickiness on its ends, the web rope can be attached to
any surface and can hold 1,000 pounds before it
breaks. Creatures who use the web rope while
climbing have advantage on their Strength (Athletics)
check to climb. After a half hour, the web rope
dissolves. You cannot use this ability again until you
complete a short rest.
The Blades of Findalay
The Swords of Findalay are equipped with special
intelligent swords which guide their mission of
diplomacy and peace.
Each of The Blades of Findalay was forged by a
master smith of its namesake country. The blades of
these longswords are large, brightly colored
gemstones. While the swords share some similar
properties, each blade is imbued with its own unique
personality, look, and a defining magical attribute.
Each of The Blades of Findalay is a magic
longsword which grants a +1 bonus to attack and
damage rolls made with it and can be used as a
spellcasting focus. When used as a spellcasting focus
the item grants a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and
spell save DCs of your spells. When all four of the
blades are within 500 feet of each other the bonuses to
attack rolls, damage rolls, and spell save DCs rises to
+3.
As a bonus action while holding on of The Blades
of Findalay you can cause the weapon to shed bright
light in a 30-foot radius and dim light in another 30
feet after that. It takes another bonus action to
extinguish the light.

The Blade of Aeranore
Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)
The blue sapphire Blade of Aeranore sings "Aeranore
the Bold," the country's national anthem, when being
swung in battle. It's gold hilt features the flag of
Aeranore on its pomel and the phrase "Power in
Knowledge" is carved on its cross-guard in Gnomish.
Flight. While attuned to the Blade of Aeranore you
have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You
can use the sword to fly for up to 1 hour, all at once or
in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of
1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the
duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per
round until you land. The sword regains its hour of
flying after you complete a long rest.
Sentience. The Blade of Aeranore is a sentient
weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of
14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has
hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.
The weapon can communicate telepathically with
its wielder and it can also speak, read, and understand
Common and Gnomish.
Personality. The Blade of Aeranore is unrelentingly
patriotic, but not overtly nationalistic. It has a love for
Aeranore, but it respects the other nations of Findalay.
It critiques the other nation's more harshly, but will
grudgingly admit when push comes to shove that
Aeranore is not perfect.
The Blade of Aeranore loves good strategy and is
always nervous if its wielder acts without a plan
whether in battle or diplomacy. The sword will always
give its own thoughts and opinions about a plan even
if its opinion is not invited. It cannot resist giving
advice for the sword feels it is better to over-prepare
than to have things go awry.
The Blade of Aeranore desires peace amongst the
kingdom and believes knowledge is more important
than strength. It is always searching for new tomes to
read particularly those which deal with Aeranore's
history. The sword has a vested interest in learning
about the other Findalayan countries as well since the
right cultural fact or historical reference can turn a
diplomatic encounter from unfavorable to favorable.
The Blade of Bragonay
Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)
The serrated, ruby Blade of Bragonay revels in combat
and laughs wildly when it is surrounded by the red
mist of blood. Its adamantine hilt is encrusted with
small diamonds and glowing red Dwarvish runes
which spell out the word, "Power."
Thrower. The Blade of Bragonay has the thrown
property with a normal range of 30 feet and a long
range of 90 feet. Immediately after a ranged attack is
made with the weapon it appears back in your hand.
Sentience. The Blade of Bragonay is a sentient
weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of
10, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has
hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.
The weapon can communicate telepathically with
its wielder and it can also speak, read, and understand
Common and Dwarvish.
Personality. The Blade of Bragonay speaks only
when necessary and usually in short, gruff sentences.
The weapon has little patience for hi-jinx and
tomfoolery that aren't in celebration of a job well
done, especially if there's still a task which needs
doing. That being said, the weapon has a soft spot for
dwarves and dwarvish culture and is extremely
protective of its wielder. If ever its wielder is
personally attacked with words or steel, the sword
comes screaming in to defend. It laughs at all of its
wielder's jokes and praises the smallest achievements
like a fool in love.
While The Blade of Bragonay supports the mission
for peace in Findalay it does love a good battle,
particularly with monsters who have no tie to any of
Findalay's governments. The weapon encourages its
wielder to kill first and ask questions never when a
band of marauding giants or evil dragon threaten the
land. The wielder of the sword finds the weapon
publicly pushes for the harshest punishments for
nations which violate the Treaty of Findalay
including its namesake country.
There are those who believe The Blade of
Bragonay to secretly send visions of Bragonay's future
world domination to its wielder. While these visions
have never been proven, it would explain why
Bragonay's last Sword murdered the others at the
behest of the nation's empress.
The Blade of Marrial
Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)
The fine emerald Blade of Marrial chants prayers
to The Sky Dragon as it swings through enemy ranks.
The silver hilt of the blade is emblazoned with images
of all manner of sea creatures as an homage to the
nation of islands.
Amphibious. While attuned to The Blade of
Marrial you have a swimming speed of 60 feet and
can breathe underwater.
Sentience. The Blade of Marrial is a sentient
weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of
12, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has
hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.
The weapon can communicate telepathically with
its wielder and it can also speak, read, and understand
Common and Draconic.
Personality. True to its democratic creators, The
Blade of Marrial supports solutions which make the
majority happy. It is easily the best negotiator of
all The Blades of Findalay because it is the most-even
tempered and patient. The sword listens to all opinions
and facts before giving its own well-reasoned stance.
The Blade of Marrial makes it a point to not show
any favoritism toward its wielder or its country. In fact
the sword goes so far as to force a new wielder to earn
its trust before beginning to impart telepathic thoughts
to it. In battle the sword preaches mercy believing
sparing a life to be the stronger option (when such an
option is available).
The Blade of Marrial has a particular hatred of
slavery. It is grudgingly accepting of Bragonay's
enslavement of the warforged because it has to be, but
refuses to speak in the presence of any who support
the enslavement other races, such as diplomats from
Parian.
The Blade of Taliana
Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)
The wicked alexandrite Blade of Taliana offers bawdy
curses in Elvish and Halfling as it cuts down enemies.
The onyx hilt of the sword is studded with small
emeralds and emblazoned with images of elf and
halfling heroes of legend.
Invisibility. As an action you can cast invisibility on
yourself while attuned to The Blade of Taliana. You 
James Introcaso
worldbuilderblog.me
can use this ability three times and then must complete
a long rest before you can cast the spell in this way
again.
Sentience. The Blade of Marrial is a sentient
weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of
16, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 18. It has
hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.
The weapon can communicate telepathically with
its wielder and it can also speak, read, and understand
Common, Elvish, and Halfling.
Personality. The Blade of Taliana is the least
formal and appropriate of all The Blades of Findalay.
It is quick with a jest and must be silenced in
diplomatic situations as often as it must be called upon
for jokes to ease tension. It japes in good fun at the
expense of its wielder and offends in poor taste at the
expense of others.
The Blade of Taliana bores easily, so it's a good
thing it finds diplomatic situations fascinating. While
on the road or deep in a dungeon, it implores its
wielder to find some mischief to get into so they might
have a story to tell. Likewise the sword pushes the
wielder to take risks in its personal life not for glory or
riches, but for the fun of it. It is no surprise that
the sword loves pranks.
When things truly seem hopeless or without proper
course, that is when The Blade of Taliana truly shines.
For all its rudeness the weapon cares for all The
Swords of Findalay and their mission and often gives
rallying speeches to bolster its allies. Above all The
Blade of Taliana does not want to see Findalay fall
into another war on its watch and acts which could
put the continent on such a course offend the sword to
its very soul more than any bawdy tale told at a fancy
dinner party.
Tools of Order
Hierotheist priestesses preach that the goddesses of the
caste created copies of their weapons for seven mighty
warriors to rise up against the chromatic dragons.
These weapons, the Tools of Order, had the laws of
the caste system eventually used in Bragonay
engraved into them. The seven dwarf warriors were
the leaders of their stations and enforced the divine
will of their goddesses. While the weapons were lost
in the war with the dragons, their laws remain in place
today. Many dwarfs spend centuries hunting for any
clue of the Tools of Order.
Some outside the Heirotheist religion claim these
weapons are not divine at all but rather made by
powerful shardmind mages. In fact these naysayers
claim that the dwarves refused to rise up with the
shardminds against the chromatic dragons so the
crystalline beings created the Tools of Order to appeal
to the dwarves' piety. They say it is the shardminds
themselves who hid these weapons so the dwarves
would never know of their deception. These
sacrilegious claims have only made seekers of
the Tools of Order all the more desperate to find the
weapons of their gods.
Each of the Tools of Order is a magic weapon
which grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with it. When you score a critical hit with one of
these weapons roll the attack's damage dice three
times and add it together with any relevant modifiers.
Each of the Tools of Order also functions as a ring of
evasion, defender, and dragonslayer.
If a non-lawful or non-dwarf creature attempts to
attune one of the weapons, it must make a DC 15
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save this creature
takes 8d6 psychic damage taking only have damage on
a successful one. The creature must repeat this saving
throw anytime it attacks with the weapon.
Random Properties. Each of the Tools of Order has
the following random properties:
 2 minor beneficial properties
 1 major beneficial property
 1 minor detrimental property
Dominate Person. While holding one of these
weapons you can cast dominate person (save DC 18).
Once you have cast the spell you cannot cast it again
until next dawn.
Strength of the Caste. If 2 or more of the Tools of
Order are within 100 feet of one another, each wielder
gains an additional +1 bonus to damage and initiative
rolls for every other weapon within range.
Destroying the Tools. The only way to destroy
the Tools of Order is by freezing them in the coldest
part of the Nine Hells and then breaking them against
the hardest stone in the Plane of Earth.
