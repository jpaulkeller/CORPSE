/ [1] Weight figures are for Medium weapons. A Small weapon weighs half as much, and a Large weapon weighs twice as much.
/ [2] When two types are given, the weapon is both types (meaning the damage is divided between the two types) if the entry specifies AND, or either type (player's choice at time of attack) if the entry specifies OR.
/ [3] The weapon deals nonlethal damage rather than lethal damage.
/ [4] Reach weapon.
/ [5] Double weapon.
/ [6] This weapon can also be used as a shield. See Armor for details.
/ [7] This weapon can be used in melee as a martial weapon but is an exotic weapon when thrown.

/ MASTERWORK WEAPONS
/ A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. 
/ Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
/ You can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon.
/ The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition, such as an arrow).
/ For example, a masterwork bastard sword costs 335 gp, while a set of 10 masterwork arrows costs 70 gp. 
/ Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).
/ Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. 
/ The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.
/ All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. 
/ The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn't stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon's magic.
/ Even though some types of armor and shields (such as spiked shields) can be used as weapons, you can't create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
/ Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties (see Masterwork Armor).

/ PRIMITIVE WEAPONS

/ Many so-called exotic weapons are weapons more common to primitive cultures, such as Stone Age humans. To reflect that fact,
/ the DM could allow primitive cultures (or even some of the more savage races, such as lizardfolk) to treat blowguns as simple 
/ weapons and any or all the following exotic weapons as martial weapons: bolas, barbed bolas, boomerang, greater blowgun, and net.
/ As a tradeoff, you could rule that such races treat bows and crossbows (of all sorts) as exotic weapons. If you want to play such
/ a character, work out a fair balance with your DM.

/ IMPROVISED WEAPONS

/ As detailed in the Player�s Handbook, objects not crafted to be used as weapons may nonetheless find use in combat. This is most true in the stereotypical tavern brawl, but any time a character can�t or doesn�t want to use a weapon, he needs to know how effective the closest object is in a fight.
/ Any creature using an improvised weapon�from a broken bottle to a barstool�in a fi ght is considered to be nonproficient with it and thus takes a �4 penalty on attack rolls made with it. An improvised weapon scores a threat (a possible critical hit) on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.
/ What about fighting with ladders, wagon wheels, or coils of rope? In the hands of a determined (or desperate) individual, these oddly shaped objects offer a wide variety of options in combat. Of course, you must still deal with the �4 penalty on attack rolls made with such a weapon, but sometimes you have to make use of what�s available!
/ Bull Rush: If you perform a bull rush while carrying a big, sturdy object (such as a bench or table), you add a +2 bonus on your Strength check to push back the defender.
/ Defense: Objects with lots of surface area (such as tables) grant you a +2 shield bonus to Armor Class (or a +4 shield bonus to AC if you use the total defense action), but require two hands to use.
/ Disarm: Any object with a lot of protrusions (such as a chair or a broken wagon wheel) or that can easily ensnare objects (such as a cloak or a ladder) grants the wielder a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
/ Entangle: Any sheetlike flexible object (such as a carpet or tapestry) can entangle an opponent with a successful ranged touch attack. An entangled creature takes a �2 penalty on attack rolls and a �4 penalty to Dexterity, can move at only half speed, cannot run or charge, and may have difficulty casting spells (see the Concentration skill description). Escaping from such an object requires a standard action and a DC 10 Escape Artist check. These objects are treated as two-handed weapons.
/ Reach: Long objects (such as ladders) have reach, allowing a Small or Medium character to strike at opponents up to 10 feet away (but not at adjacent foes). These objects are treated as two-handed weapons.
/ Trip: An object with protrustions at the end (such as a hat rack or a barstool) or that can wrap around a leg (such as a chain) can be used to make trip attempts. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the improvised weapon to avoid being tripped.

/ Improvised Weapon Damage

/ Most improvised weapons deal between 1d3 and 1d6 points of damage (usually bludgeoning, but possibly piercing or slashing). 
/ For more guidance on how much damage a weapon deals, see the table below. For every additional 200 pounds of an object's weight 
/ beyond 400 pounds, it deals an additional 1d6 points of damage, if used as an improvised weapon.
/ If an object weighs up to 2 pounds, a Medium character can treat it as a light weapon. Objects between 2 and 10 pounds are 
/ one-handed weapons for Medium characters, and objects weighing 11 to 50 pounds are two handed weapons. Halve these numbers 
/ for every size category below medium, and double them for every size category above Medium.

.Object Weight     Damage[1]           Examples
less than 2lb[2]   1d3                 Mug, Torch
2lb. - 5lb.        1d4                 Lantern, Manacles

/ [1] A sharp object deals damage as an object of twice it's weight. So a broken bottle (1lb.), deals 1d4 points of damage, not 1d3. Conversely, a soft or malleable object, such as a melon, deals damage as an object of half its weight, and the damage is non-lethal.
/ [2] If an item has no weight worth noting, it doesn't any damage when used as a weapon.
