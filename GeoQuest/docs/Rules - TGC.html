</center>

Geocaching is a high-tech adventure game enjoyed world-wide by players equipped with
GPS receivers.  Players find containers called geocaches, hidden by other players.
The geocaches are often located in interesting places that you 
might not otherwise discover.  If you're not familiar with geocaching, you can learn about
it at <em class=gameitem>www.geocaching.com</em>.

<p>
GeoQuest is a board game based on geocaching, for 2 to 6 players.
The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 25 points, or
find all of the caches on the board.  You gain points by finding caches, 
or from <em class=gameitem>Event Cards</em>.
<em class=advanced>

The map board is made up of four quadrants, and overlayed with a 24 x 24 grid of small squares called
<em class=tile>tiles</em>. The edge of each row is marked with a different letter (all letters except X and Z).
These letters are used like latitude/longitude coordinates to identify specific locations on the map.

<p>
There are five types of terrain, as well as Paths and Streams.
Even though some Clear tiles might have a few trees or rocks, each tile is
treated as a single terrain type.
Tiles can contain Paths or border Streams; these do not affect the terrain type.
The type of terrain does not affect movement directly.  However, some types of 
equipment let you move faster on certain types of terrain.   Similarly, some 
events can have different effects depending on what type of terrain you are in
when they occur.  Paths and Streams do affect movement (see the 
<em class=section>MOVEMENT</em> section below).

<h3 class=subheader>2. PLAYER SETUP</h3>

<p>
<img src="Components/Tracking Panel.png" align=right width=220>
Shuffle the Equipment and Event cards (separately).  Each player receives the following:
<ul>  
  <li>one <em class=gameitem>Cacher Token</em> (to mark your position on the map)
  <li>the matching <em class=gameitem>Tracking Panel</em> (to organize your items)</li>
  <li>some of the matching colored chips (to mark caches you've found)</li>
  <li>one random <em class=cachers>Cacher</em> card</li>
  <li>one random <em class=equipment>Equipment</em> card</li>
</ul>     

<p>
Note that Cachers also have unique advantages.  For example,
<em class=cacher>Grampa&nbsp;Gary</em> gets +1 when searching.
Don't forget to apply these special rules during the game.

<p>
<img src="Components/Avatar Blue.png" align=left width=33 style="padding-right: 5px">
<img src="Maps/Longitude Marker.png" align=right width=44 style="padding-left: 5px">
<img src="Maps/Latitude Marker.png" align=right width=44 style="padding-left: 5px">
Each Cacher Token starts just off the board, next to any one of the four
<em class=gameitem>Latitude/Longitude Arrows</em> which match the Cacher's letter.
Mark your <b>starting location</b> with one of your colored chips; 
an Event may require you to return to that spot later.

<h2 class=header>PLAYING THE GAME</h2>

<h3 class=subheader>TURN SEQUENCE</h3>

A <em class=concept>turn</em> refers to a single player.  A <em class=concept>
round</em> refers to one turn for all players (it still counts as a round, even
if some players had to skip their turn).

<p>
Each turn has two parts: (1) events, and (2) moving/searching.  At the beginning
of your turn, resolve any Event card which has been played on you.
Follow the instructions on the Event card.  In some cases, this may cause you to
end your turn before you get a chance to roll.  
<p>
Then Declare whether you are going to Move or Search.
You may only Search if your token is located in the same tile as a Cache you have not yet 
found.  You roll both dice and add the numbers 
together to determine how far you can move, or how well you searched.

<p>
Rolling doubles triggers an event; see the <em class=section>EVENTS</em> section below for more
information.  Each die has one red or green side (which counts as zero when moving);
these are explained in the <em class=section>SEARCHING</em> and <em class=section>
New Cache Event</em> sections below.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

<h3 class=subheader>MOVING</h3>

<p><em class=section>Normal Movement: </em> After rolling, you may move your token up to
the total number you rolled on both dice (from 0 to 7), plus any bonuses you may get.
You don't have to move the full amount.  
Each move must be to an adjacent tile; you may not move diagonally.
The <em class=find> FIND</em> and <em class=dnf>DNF</em> sides count as zero.

<p><img src="Rules/Terrain Path.png" align=left width=45 style="padding-right: 5px">
Using a <b>Path</b> gives you a +1 bonus when moving.  Each turn, your first move 
<em>along a Path</em> is free.  Even if you roll zero, if your token is 
on a Path, you may move one tile along that path.  Note that all Urban tiles
count as Paths.  You don't get the free move by <i>crossing</i> a path.

<p><img src="Rules/Terrain Stream.png" align=left width=45 style="padding-right: 5px">
Crossing a <b>Stream</b> costs 3 movement points,
so you'll need to roll at least a 3
(including any move bonuses) to get across.  If you roll less than 3, you 
can still move, but you can't cross the stream this turn.
This rule does not apply if you use a bridge to cross the Stream.

<p>
<img src="Icons/Move 1.png" align=left width=50 style="padding-right: 5px">
<b>Movement Bonuses:</b> Some Cachers and Equipment cards provide a bonus (or penalty) to move.
For example, if you have <em class=equipment>Binoculars</em>, you may move an 
extra tile if you rolled a four or higher.  In some cases, this bonus requires a 
certain type of terrain.  For example, <em class=equipment>Hiking&nbsp;Boots</em>
give you a +1 when you are moving on Forest tiles (you get the +1 if you move
<i>into or out of</i> any Forest tile during your turn).
You may use more than one movement bonus per turn.
	
<p>
<img src="Icons/Move Run.png" align=left width=50 style="padding-right: 5px">
<b>Jumping:</b> Some equipment (such as the <em class=equipment>FRS&nbsp;Radio</em>) and events (such
as <em class=event>Broken&nbsp;Wrist</em> and <em class=event>Meet&nbsp;and&nbsp;Greet</em>)
allow or require you to <em class=concept>jump</em> to other locations.  This means that 
you move your token to the specified location, ignoring any movement bonuses, 
penalties, or other terrain effects (such as stream crossing costs).  

<h3 class=subheader>SEARCHING</h3>

<img src="Icons/Search +1.png" align=left height=60 width=45 style="padding-right: 1px">
Each cache has a <em class=concept>Level</em> or difficulty rating -- from 1 (easiest)
to 5 (hardest).  To find the cache, you must roll equal to or higher
than the level.  Some Cachers and Equipment cards provide a bonus (or penalty) to search.
For example, if you have <em class=equipment>Flashlight</em>, you add one to your
roll if you are searching for a cache which no one has found. 

<p>
<img src="Icons/Roll FIND.png" align=left height=50 style="padding-right: 5px">
<img src="Icons/Roll DNF.png" align=right height=50 style="padding-left: 5px">
One die has a <em class=find>FIND</em> side.  If you roll this, you have found the cache.
The other has a <em class=dnf>DNF</em> "did not find" side.  If you roll the DNF, you fail to 
find the cache (no matter what you rolled on the other die).  You must wait 
until your next turn to try again.  Otherwise, apply any bonuses or penalties 
to determine your Search score.  If your Search score is equal to or higher than
the cache level, you find the cache!

<p>
Geocachers often team up to find caches.  Any time two or more cachers are both 
on the same tile, they all get credit for the find if any one of them finds the
cache.  Only the player who makes the successful Search roll gets the 
<em class=ftf>FTF</em> bonus point.  If another play finds the cache for you, 
you get the points and equipment on your next turn; you don't need to roll, and 
you don't get to move.

<h3 class=subheader>FINDING A CACHE</h3>

<img src="Rules/Point Coins.png" align=right height=120 style="padding-right: 5px">
When you find a cache:
<ul>
  <li>get a Point Coin equal to the level of the cache
  <li>if you were the first to find this cache, take the <em class=ftf>FTF</em> coin
  <li>put one of your colored chips under the cache disk to show you found it
  <li>draw an Equipment card <em class=advanced>(fun rule variation: draw two, keep one)</em>
  <li class=advanced>take and/or leave Travel Bugs (see the <em class=section>Travel Bugs</em> section)
</ul>

Finding a cache is the main way to earn points and get equipment in the game.
You gain points equal to the cache level (add the appropriate coin
onto your <em class=gameitem>Tracking Panel</em>).  
If you were the final player to find a cache, remove it from the board.
Otherwise, put one of your colored chips under the cache disk.
This allows everyone to keep track of who has found which caches.

<p>
When you find a cache while geocaching, you typically trade items.  This means
you take a trinket out of the cache, and leave something to replace it.  When you find
a cache in the GeoQuest game, you get to draw an Equipment card.  If you have an empty
slot, keep the card.  If not you'll have to discard it or one of your other equipment cards.
</p>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

<h2 class=header>GEOCACHES</h2>

<img src="Icons/Cache 2.png" align=left width=53 style="padding-right: 5px">

Caches are represented by the <em class=gameitem>Cache Disk</em> on the
map.  Each cache has a type and level (from 1 to 5) indicated by the picture
on the disk.  For example, the picture on the 
left shows a <b>normal</b> level 2 cache.  Normal caches have 
no special rules associated with them; the other cache types are described below.

<p>
<img src="Icons/Puzzle Cache 2.png" align=left width=53 style="padding-right: 5px">

<b>Puzzle caches</b> require that you solve a puzzle to get the location of 
the cache.  In GeoQuest, the row and column letters (of the tile where the 
cache is hidden) are used as part of the puzzle.  Before a player can search for the
cache, she must <em class=concept> solve the puzzle</em> by supplying a word or phrase 
that contains those two letters and fits the category (shown on the puzzle 
category token).  In most cases, the letters can appear anywhere in the solution, in any order
(there are a few puzzle-specific exceptions).
The puzzle should only be solved when the player's token is at the cache location.

<p>
Let's say you want to find a puzzle cache with the category
of <em class=concept>Sea Creatures</em> at row <em class=coord>R</em> and column
<em class=coord>C</em>.  You could solve this puzzle using the word "crab".
Another player could also solve it using a different creature such as "sea urchin".
Multi-word and proper names are usually fine; solving should be fun and not too frustrating!

<p>
Each player wanting to search for the cache must provide a different solution.
Once you've solved the puzzle, treat it just like a normal cache: you still need
to make a successful Search roll to find it.  If you fail to find it 
with your first Search roll, that's okay.  No need to solve the puzzle 
again; just search again next turn as you would for any other cache.

<div class=advanced>

<img src="Icons/Cache Multi 3x2.png" align=left width=53 style="padding-right: 5px">

<b>Multiple-stage caches</b> (multi-cache for short) require you to find one or more
<em class=concept>stages</em>, before you can find the actual cache.  In
geocaching, each stage usually contains a clue or the coordinates that lead to
the next stage.  In GeoQuest, you must make a separate Search roll for
each stage.  The number of stages is specified on the cache disk.  
To find a 3-stage (level 2) multi-cache like the one shown, you would 
have to make three successful Search rolls of two or better.

<p>
<b>Each time you successfully find a stage, you may continue rolling to 
try and find the next stage.</b>  So it is possible to find a multi-cache in a
single turn -- or it may take several turns (especially for those level 4 or higher).
You only have to find each stage once (keep count each time you make a successful
Search roll); you don't have to start over each turn.  If more than one cacher is
on the same spot, each successful Search roll counts for everyone on the tile.
Note that only the first roll on any turn may trigger an event.

</div>

<h2 class=header>EQUIPMENT</h2>

<img src="Components/Equipment Card.png" align=left height=120 style="padding-right: 5px">

Various types of geocaching gear are represented in the game using the deck of 
Equipment cards.  Although you don't need any special equipment to geocache 
(other than a GPS receiver), some of it can be quite helpful.
In the GeoQuest game, the equipment often provides a bonus, such as the
<em class=equipment>Flashlight</em>, which helps you when searching.

<p>
Other Equipment cards can prevent the effects of certain events.  For example, 
the <em class=equipment>Insect&nbsp;Repellent</em> can prevent the 
<em class=event>Mosquitoes</em> or <em class=event>Ticks</em>
from bothering you.  Most of the time you just need to have the Equipment card 
on your Tracking Panel to benefit from it.  Sometimes, you must discard the card
to use it.  For example, the <em class=equipment>First-aid&nbsp;Kit</em> can
be discarded to prevent various injury events in the game.  Unlike Event cards, 
<b>when an Equipment card is discarded, shuffle it back into the deck</b>.

<p>
You may have up to four Equipment cards (placed face up on your Tracking Panel).
If you already have all the Equipment cards that you are allowed when you draw
a new one, you must either discard it or one of your other Equipment cards. 
Some Equipment cards (such as the <em class=equipment>Backpack</em>) 
allow you to have more than four Equipment cards in play.

<div class=advanced>

<p>
<img src="Components/Ensemble Card.png" align=left height=90 hspace=5>

At the bottom of each Equipment card, there is an <em class=concept>Ensemble</em>
name.  For example, the <em class=equipment>Compass</em>, <em class=equipment>Batteries</em>, and 
<em class=equipment>Pocket&nbsp;Knife</em> cards comprise the 
<em class=ensemble>Eagle&nbsp;Scout</em> Ensemble.  Each Ensemble is made up of three
Equipment cards.  If you're lucky enough to get at least two of the cards in a particular Ensemble,
you get a special bonus (shown on the <em class=gameitem>Ensemble Reference Card</em>).  Find the
card, and add it onto your Tracking Panel.

<p>
Some of these effects (such as the <em class=ensemble>Engineer</em>
Ensemble) are triggered when a particular roll is made.  When a game effect such as
<em class=cacher>Determined&nbsp;Dan</em> allows a player to re-roll the dice, the
original (ignored) roll doesn't trigger the effect.  However if a player takes another turn, 
each roll has a chance of triggering an Ensemble bonus.
When a player makes multiple rolls while searching for a multi-cache,
each roll has a chance to trigger ensemble effects.
   
</div>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

<h2 class=header>EVENTS</h2>

<img src="Components/Event Card.png" align=left height=150 style="padding-right: 8px">
<img src="Tokens/Dice/Dice B2.png" align=right hspace=2 height=50>
<img src="Tokens/Dice/Dice W2.png" align=right hspace=2 height=50>

Whenever you want to Move or Search, you roll the dice.  If you roll 
doubles (the same number not counting zero, regardless of color),
you draw an Event card (before moving or searching).
Don't reveal the card to the other players yet.  You may keep it, or play it on yourself or
another player.  Players may only keep one Event card at a time though, so if you 
already have one, you'll have to play or discard one of them.

<p>  
To play an Event card on yourself, reveal it (and discard it) at the beginning of your turn, before you roll.
To play one on another player, place it face-up in front of that player.
The event will take effect at the beginning of that player's next turn.
Only one Event card can be played on a person at a time though, so you can't target
a player who already has an Event card played on them.  
Unlike Equipment cards, <b>when an Event card is discarded or resolved, remove it from the game</b>.  

<p>
Some event cards (such as <em class=event>Fresh&nbsp;Snow</em>) are marked <em class=dnf>PLAY NOW</em>.
If you draw one of these, follow the instructions immediately, before 
moving or searching.  Others (such as <em class=event>Helpful&nbsp;Hint</em>) are marked 
<em class=find>PLAY ANY TIME</em>.  You may discard this type of event 
card whenever you like (<b>even after you roll</b>) to have it take effect. 

<p>
Most events only affect the current player during her turn.  Some events
affect more than one player, or last one or more rounds.  For multi-round events you may
want to add markers on the card, and remove a marker as each round ends.  Even if an event is not
resolved immediately, the card is removed from play (and another Event card may be played on that player).

Check the <em class=section>Clarifications</em> online if you have any questions.

<h4>New Cache Event</h4>

<img src="Icons/Roll FIND.png" align=left hspace=1 height=50>

If you roll both Cache icons, you have triggered a New Cache Event.  Your turn is over (you don't move, 
or find any cache you may have been searching for), but you get to add a new cache
onto the board, and you earn two points!  Randomly select a cache disk to place.  

<h4>Random Cache Placement</h4>

New caches should be placed randomly.  You can choose a random location by
selecting two <em class=cachers>Cacher</em> cards (each card has a unique letter). 
One determines the latitude/row, and the other determines the longitude/column.
The rows and columns are marked with the letters of the alphabet.
For example, if you pick "R" and "C", place the cache disk in row <em class=coord>R</em>,
column <em class=coord>C</em>.
Caches cannot be placed on the lake, and two caches cannot be on the same tile; roll again if needed.

<h3>TRAVEL BUGS</h3>

<img src="Components/Travel Bug.png" align=left hspace=3 height=50>

Travel Bugs are represented in GeoQuest using ladybug tokens.
Players can acquire them by finding a cache which contains them.
If a cache you found contains any Travel Bugs, you may take one (at most);
move it from the map onto your Tracking Panel.

<p>
If you have any Travel Bugs with you when you end your turn on a tile that contains a 
cache which you have found, you may leave them in that cache.  To do so, put the
<em class=gameitem>Travel Bug token</em> from your Tracking Panel onto the cache.
You can leave any number of these in the cache; you gain one point for each 
one you leave.  You can't leave one in the same cache that you got it from.

<p>

Each Travel Bug has a goal (shown on the token).
If you achieve its goal, then you gain three points (instead of the one point 
you normally get).  For example, you could leave the Travel Bug shown on the right
in any cache which is next to a Stream to achieve its goal.
<b>When a Travel Bug reaches its goal, it is removed from the game.</b>

<p>
Sometimes a Travel Bug might start out in a cache that would satisfy its goal;
if that happens, you must find another cache to earn the three points.
In some cases, it may not be possible for a Travel Bug to reach its goal; but you can 
still gain one point by leaving it in a cache.
