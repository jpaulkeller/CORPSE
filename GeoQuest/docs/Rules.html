 <h1 style=background-color:lightgreen>GeoQuest</h1>
 <h3><i>The closest you can get to geocaching in a box!</i></h3>
</center>

<h2 class=header>INTRODUCTION and GOAL</h2>

Geocaching is a high-tech adventure game enjoyed world-wide by players equipped with
GPS receivers.  The basic idea is to find containers called geocaches, hidden outdoors
by other players.  The geocaches are often located in interesting places that you 
might not otherwise find.  If you're not familiar with geocaching, you can learn about
it at <em class=gameitem>www.geocaching.com</em>.

<p>
GeoQuest is a board game based on geocaching, for 2 to 6 players, ages 12 and up.
Once you learn how to play, a typical games takes about 30 minutes.  
The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 25 points, or
find all of the caches on the board.  You gain points by finding caches, 
helping Travel Bugs reach their goal, or from various events that happen 
randomly during the game. It is possible to lose points, but you can never
go below zero.

<p class=advanced>
If you're just learning to play, you can skip the sections highlighted like this
for now.
</p>

<h2 class=header>CONTENTS</h2>

Your GeoQuest game comes with the following components:
<ul>
 <li>Game Board (includes map frame and 4 double-sided map sections)
 <li>Two special 6-sided dice (for moving, searching, and triggering events)
 <li>A 30-sided <em class=gameitem>Alphabet die</em> (for rolling random locations)
 <li>Colored Cacher tokens (1 per player, for marking your position on the map)
 <li>Colored chips (1 set per player, for marking caches as they are found)
 <li>Three decks of cards: <em class=cacher>Cacher&nbsp;Characters</em>,
     <em class=equipment>Equipment</em>, and <em class=event>Events</em>
 <li>Cache disks showing the type and difficulty rating of the caches
     (placed on the map board to mark cache locations)
 <li>Puzzle Category chips (used for Puzzle caches; see below)
 <li>Six color-coded Cacher Tracking panels
 <li>Assorted Point and First-to-Find (FTF) coins, for keeping track of your points
 <li class=advanced>Travel Bug disks (these show the Travel Bug's goal)</li>
 <li class=advanced>A few blank cards are provided for you to make up your own.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class=subheader>THE MAP BOARD</h3>

The map board is made up of separate sections called 
<em class=concept>quadrants</em>.  Grid lines are marked so that each section
is divided into 169 (13 x 13) smaller squares called <em class=concept>tiles</em>.
Four sections are placed together in the map frame to create the map board.
Each section is double-sided; you may place either side face up.  The sections
are square; you may rotate them any way you like.  Sometimes paths or streams from
one section may connect with another, but it's okay if they don't.  By flipping,
moving, or rotating the sections, you can produce thousands of different map boards.

<p>
There are five types of terrain on the map board, as well as Paths and Streams.
Even though some Rocky tiles might have a few trees, or some Forest tiles might
have clear spots, each tile is treated as a single terrain type.  Tiles can 
contain Paths or Streams, but these do not affect the terrain type.

<p>
The type of terrain does not affect movement directly.  However, some types of 
equipment let you move faster on certain types of terrain.   Similarly, some 
events can have different effects depending on what type of terrain you are in
when they occur.  Paths and Streams do affect movement (see the 
<em class=section>MOVEMENT</em> section below).

<div class=advanced>

<h4>Special Locations</h4>

<img src="images/WaterfallIcon.png" align=left>

There are several special locations marked on the map.  Some of these are 
man-made, such as the Zoo, the Cemetery, the Hospital, and the Police Station.
Others are natural, such as the Waterfalls and the Scenic Views.  These locations
are used by some of the Event cards, and also by some of the Travel Bugs.

</div>

<h2 class=header>PREPARATION</h2>

Unfold the map frame, and arrange the 4 map quadrants to form the map board.

<h3 class=subheader>INITIAL CACHE PLACEMENT</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Pick 8 random <em class=gameitem>Cache Disks</em>, and place them face-up
     on any map tiles (except the lake).  Only one cache can occupy a tile.  
     Spread them around the board (2 in each quadrant), among the various terrain types.
     For any Puzzle caches, select a random <em class=gameitem>Puzzle Category
     chip</em>, and place it under the cache chip.</li>  
 <li>Add a <em class=ftf>FTF</em> coin under each cache disk; these
     are bonus prizes (worth 1 point) for the first person to find the cache.</li>
 <li class=advanced>Each player draws one <em class=gameitem>Travel Bug</em>, 
     and places that chip under any cache chip.</li>
</ol>     

<p>
Any player may view any of these tokens at any time; the puzzle categories or 
Travel Bugs are not secret.  Usually it's best to keep the Cache Disk on top,
since that's the most important one to know about when you're planning your moves. 

<h3 class=subheader>PLAYER SETUP</h3>

<p>
Shuffle the Equipment and Event cards (separately), and place the decks within reach.
Give each player the following:
<ul>     
  <li>one of the colored <em class=gameitem>Cacher Tokens</em> (to mark your position on the map)</li>
  <li>the matching set of colored chips (to mark caches you've found)</li>
  <li>the matching <em class=gameitem>Tracking Panel</em> (to help organize your items)</li>
  <li>one random <em class=gameitem>Cacher Character</em> card</li>
  <li>one random <em class=gameitem>Equipment</em> card</li>
  <li class=advanced>one random <em class=gameitem>Travel Bug</em> chip</li>
</ul>     

<p>
Note that Cacher Characters also have unique advantages and disadvantages.  For 
example, <em class=cacher>Athletic&nbsp;Amanda</em> gets +1 when searching in
Rocky terrain.  Don't forget to apply these special rules during the game.
Each player starts with a random Equipment card.  Place that card on your
<em class=gameitem>Tracking Panel</em>.

<!-- <div style="page-break-before: always;"></div> -->

<h3 class=subheader>STARTING LOCATION</h3>

After all caches have been placed, roll the <em class=gameitem>Alphabet die</em>
to determine your starting location.  Each Cacher Token starts on one of the
<em class=gameitem>Latitude/Longitude Arrows</em> around the map frame.  There
are 4 arrows for each letter (one on each side of the map); you may start on any
of these four arrows not already occupied by another player's token.  You can use
one of your colored chips to mark your starting location; an Event may require you
to return to that spot later.

<h2 class=header>PLAYING THE GAME</h2>

<h3 class=subheader>TURN SEQUENCE</h3>

A <em class=concept>turn</em> refers to a single player.  A <em class=concept>
round</em> refers to one turn for all players (it still counts as a round, even
if some players had to skip their turn).

<p>
Each turn has two parts: (1) events, and (2) moving/searching.  At the beginning
of your turn, you must resolve any Event card which has been played on you.
Follow the instructions on the Event card.  In some cases, this may cause you to
end your turn before you get a chance to roll.  
<p>
Each turn, you declare whether you are going to Move, or Search.  You may only
Search if your token is located in the same tile as a Cache you have not yet 
found.  You roll both 6-sided dice to Move or Search and add the numbers 
together to determine how far you can move (or how well you searched).

<p>
The dice are slightly different.  Both have sides with pips like normal dice, 
representing numbers from zero to four.  Various combinations are possible, so
that you can roll a total between 0 and 7; the average is 3.  Rolling doubles 
triggers an event; see the <em class=section>EVENTS </em> section below for more
information.  Each die also has one special (red or green) side with a cache icon,
which is explained in the <em class=section>SEARCHING</em> and <em class=section>
New Cache Event</em> sections below.

<h3 class=subheader>MOVING</h3>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 border=1>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/Moving.jpg"></td>
<td>
<em class=section>Normal Movement</em><br>
When moving, you may move your token up to the total number you rolled on both 
dice (plus any bonuses you may get).  This can be from 0 to 7 tiles (or more 
with bonuses). You don't have to move the full amount.   Each step of your move
must be to an adjacent tile; you may not move diagonally.  The <em class=find>
FIND</em> and <em class=dnf>DNF</em> sides count as zero.
</td></tr>

<tr class=advanced>
<td><img src="images/MovePathBonus.png"></td>
<td>
<em class=section>Paths</em><br>

<p>
Using a Path gives you a +1 bonus when moving.  Each turn, your first move 
<em>along a Path</em> is free.  Even if you roll zero, if your token is 
on a Path, you can move one tile along that path.  Note that all Urban tiles
count as Paths.  You don't get the free move just by crossing a path.
</p>

</td></tr>

<tr class=advanced>
<td><img src="images/MoveStreamCrossing.png"></td>
<td>
<em class=section>Streams</em><br>
Unlike Paths, Streams occur at the edge between tiles.  Crossing a stream
costs 3 movement points, so you'll need to roll at least a 3 (including
any move bonuses) in order to get across.  If you roll less than 3, you 
can still move, but you can't cross the stream.
This rule does not apply if you cross the Stream using one of the bridges.
</td></tr>

</table>

<!-- <div style="page-break-before: always;"></div> -->

<h4>Movement Bonuses</h4>

Some Cacher Characters and Equipment cards gives you a bonus (or penalty) to move.
For example, if you have the <em class=equipment>Binoculars</em>, you may move an 
extra tile if you rolled a 4 or higher.  In some cases, this bonus requires a 
certain type of terrain.  For example, the <em class=equipment>Hiking&nbsp;Boots</em>
give you a +1 when you are moving in Forest terrain (you get the +1 if you move
into any Forest tile during your turn).  You may use more than one movement bonus
per turn.  So, if you happen to have the <em class=equipment>Hiking&nbsp;Boots</em>
and the <em class=equipment>Binoculars</em>, you can combine them to move 2 extra 
tiles on a single turn.
	
<h4>Jumping</h4>

Some equipment (such as the <em class=equipment>FRS&nbsp;Radio</em>) and events (such
as <em class=event>Broken&nbsp;Wrist</em> and <em class=event>Meet&nbsp;and&nbsp;Greet</em>)
allow you to <em class=concept>jump</em> to other locations.  This simply means that 
you move your token to another location, ignoring any movement bonuses, 
penalties, or other terrain effects (such as Stream crossing restrictions).  

<h3 class=subheader>SEARCHING</h3>

Each cache has a <em class=concept>Difficulty Rating</em> -- from 1 (the easiest)
to 5 (the hardest).  In order to find the cache, you must roll equal to or higher
than the Difficulty Rating.  Some Cacher Characters and Equipment cards gives you
a bonus (or penalty) to search.  For example, if you have the <em class=equipment>
Flashlight</em>, you add 1 to your roll if you're searching for a cache no one
has found yet. 

<p>
One die has a special <em class=find>FIND</em> side.  If you roll this, you 
automatically find any cache you are searching for.  The other die has a special
<em class=dnf>DNF</em> (<i>did not find</i>) side.  If you roll the DNF, you fail to 
find the cache (no matter what your rolled on the other die).  You must wait 
until your next turn to try again.  Otherwise, apply any bonuses or penalties 
to determine your Search score.  If your Search score is equal to or higher than
the cache Difficulty Rating, you find the cache!

<p>
Geocachers often team up to find caches.  Any time two or more cachers are both 
on the same tile, they all get credit for the find if any one of them finds the
cache.  Only the player who makes the successful Search roll gets the 
<em class=ftf>FTF</em> bonus point.  If another play finds the cache for you, 
you get the points and equipment on your next turn; you don't need to roll (and 
you don't get to move).

   <li>draw two Equipment cards, and put one Equipment card back in the deck
   <li class=advanced>take and/or leave Travel Bugs (see the <em class=section>Travel Bug</em> section)
  </ul>
  </td>

</table>

Finding a cache is the main way to earn points and get equipment in the game.
You score points equal to the cache Difficulty Rating (add the appropriate coin
to your pile of Point coins on your <em class=gameitem>Tracking Panel</em>).  
If you were the final player to find a cache (in other words, all players have 
now found it), you remove it from the board. Otherwise, put one of your colored
chips under the cache chip.  This allows everyone to keep track of which players
have found which caches.

<p>
When you find a cache while geocaching, you typically trade items.  This means
you take a trinket out of the cache, and leave something to replace it.  You
should leave something of equal or greater value.  When you find
a cache in the GeoQuest game, you get to draw 2 Equipment cards from the deck.
You can keep either (or both) of these, but you must return 1 Equipment card
(to the bottom of the deck).  So, you'll gain 1 Equipment card each time you find a
cache (as long as you have room for the Equipment).
</p>

<h2 class=header>GEOCACHES</h2>

<h4>Normal (Traditional) Caches</h4>

<img src="images/Geocache-Normal-2.png" align=left hspace=10>

Caches are represented by the <em class=gameitem>Cache Chip</em> on the
map.  Each cache has a type which corresponds to the picture on the chip. 
Each cache also has a Difficulty Rating (from 1 to 5), which is shown in a
circle on the bottom-right side of the chip.  For example, the cache on the 
left is a Normal one, and has a Difficulty rating of 2.  Normal caches have 
no special rules associated with them; the other cache types are described below.

<div class=advanced>

<h4>Multi Caches</h4>

<img src="images/Geocache-Multi2-3.png" align=left hspace=10>

Multiple-stage caches (Multi cache for short) require you to find one or more
<em class=concept>stages</em>, before you can find the actual cache.  In
geocaching, each stage usually contains a clue or the coordinates that lead to
the next stage.  In GeoQuest, you must make a separate Search roll for
each stage.  The number of stages is specified on the cache chip.  
To find a 2-stage Multi cache (with Difficulty 3) like the one shown, you would 
have to make 2 successful Search rolls of 3 or better.

<p>
<b>Each time you successfully find a stage, you may continue rolling to 
try and find the next stage.</b>  So it is possible to find a Multi cache in a
single turn, although it's unlikely (especially for those level 4 or higher).
You only have to find each stage once (keep count each time you make a successful
Search roll); you don't have to start over each turn.  If more than one cacher is
on the same spot, each successful Search roll counts for everyone on the team.
Note that only the first roll on any turn may trigger an event.

</div>

<h4>Puzzle Caches</h4>

<img src="images/Geocache-Puzzle-4.png" align=left hspace=10>

Puzzle caches require that you solve a puzzle in order to get the location of 
the cache.  In GeoQuest, the row and column letters (of the tile where the 
cache is hidden) are used as part of the puzzle.  Before a player can search for the
cache, she must <em class=concept> solve the puzzle</em> by supplying a name 
that contains those two letters and fits the Category (shown on the puzzle 
category chip).  The letters can appear anywhere in the solution, in any order.
The puzzle can only be solved when the player's token is at the cache location.

<p>
Let's say you want to find a Puzzle cache with the category
of <em class=concept>Animals</em> at row <em class=coord>U</em> and column
<em class=coord>Z</em>.  You could solve this puzzle using the word "buzzard".
Another player could also solve it using a different animal such as "zebra mussel".
Multi-word names are acceptable; some categories allow proper names as well.

<p>
Each player who wants to search for the cache must come up with her own solution.
Once you've solved the puzzle, treat it just like a normal cache.  You still need
to make a successful Search roll in order to find it.  If you fail to find it 
with your first Search roll, that's okay.  You don't need to solve the puzzle 
again; just continue to search as you would for any other cache.

<!-- <div style="page-break-before: always;"></div> -->

<h2 class=header>EQUIPMENT</h2>

Various types of geocaching gear are represented in the game using the deck of 
Equipment cards.  Although you don't need any special equipment to geocache 
(other than a GPS receiver), some of it can be quite helpful.  Sometimes the
equipment will have a built-in bonus, such as the <em class=equipment>Flashlight</em>, 
which helps you when searching.

<img src="images/BugSpray.jpg" align=left>

<p>
Other Equipment cards can prevent the effects of certain events.  For example, 
the <em class=equipment>Insect&nbsp;Repellent</em> can prevent the 
<em class=event>Mosquitoes</em> or <em class=event>Ticks</em>
from bothering you.  Most of the time you just need to have the Equipment card 
on your Tracking Panel to benefit from it.  Sometimes, you must discard the card
in order to use it.  For example, the <em class=equipment>First-aid&nbsp;Kit</em> can
be discarded to prevent various injury events in the game.  Unlike Event cards, 
<b>when an Equipment card is discarded, shuffle it back into the deck</b>.

<img src="images/Backpack.png" align=right>

<p>
You may have up to 4 Equipment cards (played face up on your Tracking Panel).
If you already have all the Equipment cards that you are allowed when you draw
a new one, you must either discard it or one of your other Equipment cards. 
Some Equipment cards (such as the <em class=equipment>Backpack</em>) 
allow you to have more than 4 Equipment cards in play.

<div class=advanced>

<h3>EQUIPMENT COMBOS</h3>

At the bottom of each Equipment card, there is a <em class=concept>Combo</em>
name.  For example, the <em class=equipment>Binoculars</em> and 
<em class=equipment>Field&nbsp;Guide</em> cards comprise the 
<em class=combo>Bird&nbsp;Watcher</em> Combo.  Each Combo is made up of two 
Equipment cards.  If you're lucky enough to get both cards in a particular Combo,
you get a special bonus (shown below). You can refer to the list
below to remind yourself of the effects.

<p>
Some of these special effects (such as the <em class=combo>Bird&nbsp;Watcher</em>
Combo) are triggered when a particular roll is made.  Only rolls that count have
a chance of triggering Combo bonuses.  When a game effect (such as
<em class=cacher>Determined&nbsp;Dan</em>) allows a player to re-roll the dice, the
first roll is ignored.  However if a player takes another turn, each of those
rolls count, and therefore each roll has a chance of triggering a Combo bonus.
When a player makes multiple rolls while searching for a Multi cache,
only the first roll has a chance to trigger events or combo effects.
   
</div>

<h2 class=header>EVENTS</h2>

<img src="images/EventRoll.png" align=left hspace=10>

Whenever you want to Move or Search, you roll the two 6-sided dice.  If you roll 
doubles, you draw an Event card (before moving or searching).  Don't reveal the card
to the other players yet.  You may keep it, or play it on yourself or any
other player.  Players may only keep one Event card at a time though, so if you 
already have one, you'll have to play or discard one of them.  

<p>
To play an Event card, simply place it face-up in front of the player you want
to target.  The event will take effect at the beginning of that player's next turn.
Only one Event card can be played on a person at a time though, so you can't target
a player who already has an Event card in play.  Unlike Equipment cards, <b>when an
Event card is discarded or resolved, remove it from the game</b>.  

<h4>Special Events</h4>

Most events only affect the current player.  In some cases, an event may 
affect more that one player, or may last one or more rounds.  See the
<em class=section>Clarifications</em> section if you have questions about these events.
Some event cards (such as <em class=event>Fresh&nbsp;Snow</em>) are marked <em class=dnf>Resolve Now</em>.
If you draw one of these, you must follow the instructions immediately, before 
moving or searching.  Others (such as <em class=event>Helpful&nbsp;Hint</em>) are marked 
<em class=find>Discard To Resolve</em>.  You may discard this type of event 
card (after you roll, if you like), to have it take effect.

<h4>New Cache Event and Random Cache Placement</h4>

<img src="images/CacheDice.png" align=left hspace=10>

If you roll both Cache icons (the <em class=find>FIND</em> and <em class=dnf>DNF</em>
sides), you have triggered a New Cache Event.  Your turn is over (you don't move, 
or find any cache you may have been searching for), but you get to add a new cache
onto the board, and you earn 2 points!  Randomly select a cache chip to place.  

<p>
<img src="images/AlphabetDice.png" align=right>

New caches should be placed randomly.  You can choose a random location by rolling
the <em class=gameitem>Alphabet die</em> twice (once to determine the latitude/row,
and once to determine the longitude/column).  The rows and columns are marked 
with the letters of the alphabet.  For example, if you roll "S" and "V", place
the cache token in row <em class=coord>S</em>, column <em class=coord>V</em>.
Two caches cannot be on the same tile; roll again if necessary to avoid that.

<p>
The <em class=gameitem>Alphabet die</em> has all 26 letters of the alphabet, as
well as 4 <em class=concept>wilds</em>.  If you roll one of the wilds, you can
choose any letter you like.  If you roll a wild for your column (for example),
you may choose any tile along the row you rolled.  If you roll wild on your
first roll, you may roll for the column before choosing which row you want.

<h3>TRAVEL BUGS</h3>

Travel Bugs are represented in GeoQuest using small chips.  Players start
the game with one Travel Bug, and can acquire more by finding a cache that
contains them.  If the cache you found contains any Travel Bugs, you may take one.
If you do, move it from the map onto your Tracking Panel.  You may only take one
Travel Bug, and only if you don't already have two.

<p>
If you have any Travel Bugs with you when you end your turn on a tile that contains a 
cache that you have found, you may leave them in that cache.  To do so, move the
Travel Bug chip from your Tracking Panel onto the cache.
You can leave any number of these in the cache; you gain 1 point for each 
one you leave.  You can't leave one in the same cache that you got it from.

<img src="images/TravelBug.jpg" align=right>

<p>
Each Travel Bug has a goal (shown on the <em class=gameitem>Travel Bug chip</em>).
If you help it reach its goal, then you score 3 points (instead of the 1 point 
you normally get).  For example, you could leave the Travel Bug shown on the right
in any cache which is next to a Stream to achieve its goal.  You may want to re-visit
a cache which you have previously found in order to leave a Travel Bug.  That's fine;
you don't have to search for the cache again once you've found it; just end your turn
on the tile containing that cache.

<p>
Sometimes a Travel Bug might start out in a cache that would satisfy its goal;
if that happens, you must find another cache in order to earn the 3 points.
<b>When a Travel Bug reaches its goal, it is removed from the game.</b>  In some
cases, it may not be possible for a Travel Bug to reach its goal; but you can 
still score 1 point by leaving it in a cache.

<center><h2 class=header>CLARIFICATIONS</h2></center>	

<b>Unless the card says otherwise...</b>  Some cards will contradict the basic game rules.
When that happens, follow the instructions on the card.

<h4>Cache Characters</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=cacher>Jolly&nbsp;Jamie</em>:
The <em class=equipment>Geocoin</em> Equipment cards do count towards a 
player's total points, but the <em class=equipment>CITO&nbsp;Bag</em> does not.

<li><em class=cacher>Independent&nbsp;Isabel</em>: A map <em class=concept>quadrant
</em> is the separate board piece that represents a quarter of the total map area.

</ul>

<h4>Puzzle Cache Categories</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=puzzle>5-LETTER WORDS</em>: The solution must be a five letter word.
<li><em class=puzzle>___ & ___ PHRASES</em>: The solution must be a common phrase
such as <i>Salt & Pepper</i> (don't count the word "and").
<li><em class=puzzle>BLUE or YELLOW</em>: The solution must be something that is
either blue or yellow (or both). 
<li><em class=puzzle>FIRST & LAST</em>: The solution can be any word, with the 
puzzle letters as the first and last letters in the word (either order). 
<li><em class=puzzle>SIDE BY SIDE</em>: The solution can be any word, but the 
puzzle letters must be next to each other. 

</ul> 

<h4>Equipment and Combos</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=equipment>Cell&nbsp;Phone</em>: You may choose to take the +1 
bonus after you roll.

<li><em class=equipment>First-aid&nbsp;Kit</em>: Injury Event cards include 
<em class=event>Blisters</em>, 
<em class=event>Broken&nbsp;Wrist</em>, and
<em class=event>Twisted&nbsp;Ankle</em>.

<li><em class=combo>Insulation</em>: For example, if the
<em class=event>Litterbug</em> event card is played on you, you would only lose 
1 point instead of 4.
 
<li><em class=combo>Karma</em>: If the event is discarded, other events may still
be played on you this turn.

<li><em class=combo>Naturalist</em>: Wildlife Event cards include 
<em class=event>13-Year&nbsp;Cicadas</em>, 
<em class=event>Bear&nbsp;Encounter</em>, 
<em class=event>Fire&nbsp;Ants</em>, 
<em class=event>Fox&nbsp;Hunt</em>, 
<em class=event>Ivory-billed&nbsp;Woodpecker</em>, 
<em class=event>Killer&nbsp;Bees</em>, 
<em class=event>Mosquitoes</em>, 
<em class=event>Ticks</em>, and
<em class=event>What&nbsp;Kind&nbsp;of&nbsp;Snake&nbsp;Is&nbsp;That?</em>.

<li><em class=combo>Weatherman</em>: Weather Event cards include
<em class=event>Bad&nbsp;Weather</em>,  
<em class=event>Caught&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Rain</em>, 
<em class=event>Winter&nbsp;is&nbsp;Coming</em>, 
<em class=event>Drought</em>, 
<em class=event>Early&nbsp;Frost</em>, 
<em class=event>Flash&nbsp;Flood</em>,
<em class=event>Fresh&nbsp;Snow</em>, and
<em class=event>Heavy&nbsp;Rain</em>.
 
</ul>

<h4>Events</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=event>13-Year&nbsp;Cicadas</em>: This event lasts two rounds.  In
other words, it affects all players for their next two turns.  Place this card on
the map board, so all players can see it.  Remove it from the game after
it has been in effect for two rounds.  Although only one Event card may be played
per turn, other events may be played while a multi-turn event is in effect.
Other Event cards that last a round or more include:
<em class=event>Drought</em>, 
<em class=event>Fresh&nbsp;Snow</em>,
<em class=event>Heavy&nbsp;Rain</em>, and  
<em class=event>Solar&nbsp;Flares</em>.

<li><em class=event>Bug&nbsp;Swap</em>: If no one else has a Travel Bug, ignore this
event.

<li><em class=event>Cache&nbsp;Pirates</em>: Any Travel Bug in the cache is removed
from the game.

<li><em class=event>Equipment&nbsp;Rental</em>: If you lose the equipment you rented
for any reason, return it to the deck. 

<li><em class=event>Eureka!</em>: If you're having trouble solving a particular
Puzzle cache, you may play this card instead.  Or you can play it to find a hard
cache.  It only replaces as a single Search roll though, so you would still have
to roll for the other stages of a Multi cache.  Since this is a <em class=find>
Discard To Resolve</em> card, you may play it after you roll.

<li><em class=event>Meet&nbsp;and&nbsp;Greet</em>: This is known as an Event Cache
in geocaching.  Roll the <em class=gameitem>Alphabet&nbsp;die</em> twice to 
determine the location of the party.

<li><em class=event>Lost&nbsp;and&nbsp;Found</em>: If the player you give the card to
doesn't have room, that player must discard a card (they may discard the one
you gave them).

<li><em class=event>May&nbsp;I&nbsp;Borrow&nbsp;That?</em>: You can only borrow a 
<em class=concept>pack</em> Equipment card (such as the <em class=equipment>
Backpack</em>, <em class=equipment>Belt&nbsp;Pack</em>, <em class=equipment>
Hydration&nbsp;Pack</em>, <em class=equipment>Safari&nbsp;Vest</em>,
<em class=equipment>Swag&nbsp;Bag</em> or <em class=equipment>
Waterproof&nbsp;Jacket</em>) if doing so would not cause that player to have 
more Equipment cards than he's allowed to hold.  You can't borrow rented equipment.

<li><em class=event>Shortcut</em>: Allows you to move up to 6 tiles even if you
cross a stream.

<li><em class=event>Upgrade</em>: If there is more than one player with the 
fewest Equipment cards, you may choose the player.  See the <em class=event>
Lost&nbsp;and&nbsp;Found</em> clarification above.
