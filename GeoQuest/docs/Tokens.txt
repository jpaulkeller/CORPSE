CACHE TOKENS

  Cache Types;
   - normal / traditional
  	- micro
  	- puzzle
  	- multi
  
  difficulty: 1-5 on one side, blank on the other
  
Cache tokens have the name of the cache, the type of the cache, and the 
difficulty.  This information is on both sides.  One side shows the closed box
icon.  This means the cache has not yet been found.  When you start the game,
all cache tokens should be placed with this side facing up.  If you are the 
first one to find the cache (called FTF for First-To-Find), you get some 
special benefits (See the First To Find section).  Once a cache has been found,
you flip the token (so it shows the open-box icon).  Other players may still 
find the cache, and still have to Search to find it, but they only draw 1 
Equipment card when they do.

All of the cache names, types, and ratings are from real caches, listed on www.geocaching.com.
