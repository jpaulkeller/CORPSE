 <h1 style=background-color:lightgreen>GPS QUEST</h1>
 <h3><i>The closest you can get to geocaching in a box!</i></h3>
</center>

<h2>GOAL</h2>

The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 25 points, or
find all of the caches on the board.  You gain points by finding caches, 
helping travel bugs reach their goal, or from various events that happen 
randomly during the game. It is also possible to lose points, but you can
never go below zero.

<p class=advanced>
If you're just learning to play, you can skip the sections highlighted like this
for now.
</p>

<h2>CONTENTS</h2>

Your GPS Quest game comes with the following components:
<ul>
 <li>Game Board (includes map frame, 4 map sections, and the Active Caches Panel)
 <li>Two special 6-sided dice (for moving, searching, and triggering events)
 <li>A 30-sided <em class=gameitem>Alphabet die</em> (for rolling random locations)
 <li>Colored Cacher tokens (1 per player, for marking your position on the map)
 <li>Colored pegs (1 set per player, for marking caches as they are found)
 <li>Three decks of cards (<em class=cacher>Cacher&nbsp;Characters</em>,
     <em class=equipment>Equipment</em>, and <em class=event>Events</em>)
 <li>Numbered Cache boxes (placed on the map board to mark cache locations)
 <li>Six color-coded Cacher Tracking panels
 <li>Assorted Point and <em class=ftf>FTF</em> coins (for keeping track of your points)
 <li>Cache Labels (these show the name, type and difficulty rating of the caches)
 <li>Travel Bug labels (these show the Travel Bug's goal)
</ul>

<p class=advanced>
A few blank cards are provided for each deck, as well as some blank cache labels
and travel bugs.  These aren't required in the game; they are for you to use so 
you can make up your own Cacher Characters, Equipment, Events, Geocaches,  
Travel Bugs, and Combos.  If you do invent some fun ones, be sure to post them
at our web site (<em class=tbd>www.gpsquest.com</em>), so other players can share
them!
</p>
 
<h3>THE MAP BOARD</h3>

The map board is made up of separate sections, generally referred to as 
<em class=concept>quadrants</em>.  Grid lines are marked so that each section
is divided into 169 (13 x 13) smaller squares called <em class=concept>tiles</em>.
Four sections are placed together in the map frame to create the map board.
 Each section is double-sided; you may place either side face up.  The sections
are square; you may rotate them any way you like.  Sometimes paths or streams from
one section may connect with another, but it's okay if they don't.  By flipping,
moving, or rotating the sections, you can produce thousands of different map boards.

<h4>Terrain</h4>

<p>
There are five types of terrain on the map board, as well as Paths and Streams.
Even though some Rocky tiles might have a few trees, or some Forest tiles might
have clear spots, each tile is treated as a single terrain type.  Tiles can 
contain Paths or Streams, but these do not affect the terrain type.

<p>
The type of terrain does not affect movement directly.  However, some types of 
equipment let you move faster on certain types of terrain.   Similarly, some 
events can have different effects depending on what type of terrain you are in
when they occur.  Paths and Streams do affect movement (see the 
<em class=section>MOVEMENT</em> section below).

<div class=advanced>

<h4>Special Locations</h4>

<img src="images/rules/WaterfallIcon.png" align=left>

There are several special locations marked on the map.  Some of these are 
man-made, such as the Zoo, the Cemetery, the Hospital, and the Police Station.
Others are natural, such as the Waterfalls and the Scenic Views.  These locations
are used by some of the Event cards, and also by some of the Travel Bugs.

</div>

<h2>PREPARATION</h2>

Assemble the map frame, and arrange the 4 map quadrants to form the map board.

<ol>
 <li>Each player draws two <em class=gameitem>Cache Labels</em> from the bag, and 
     places them on any of the 12 empty numbered cache slots on the 
     <em class=gameitem>Active Caches Panel</em>.  If there are only two players,
     draw four caches each; for three players, draw three each instead.  
 <li>Add one of the <em class=ftf>FTF</em> coins onto the cache slot also; this
     is a prize for the first person to find that cache.  
 <li>Find the <em class=gameitem> Cache Box Token</em> that matches the slot 
     number.  Place that token on any map tile.  Only one cache token can occupy
     a tile.  Try to spread them around the board, among the various terrain types.
 <li>Each player draws one <em class=gameitem>Travel Bug</em>, and places that
     token on any (non-Micro) cache.
</ol>     

<h3>PLAYER SETUP</h3>

<table class="image" align=right hspace=20>
<caption align="bottom">
  <em class=gameitem>Cacher Tracking Panel</em>
</caption><tr><td>
<img src="images/rules/TrackingPanel.jpg">
</tr></table>

<p>
Shuffle the Event cards, and place them within reach.
Give each player the following:
<ul>     
  <li>one of the colored <em class=gameitem>Cacher Tokens</em>
  <li>the matching set of colored pegs
  <li>the matching <em class=gameitem>Tracking Panel</em>
  <li>one random <em class=gameitem>Cacher Character</em> card
  <li>one random <em class=gameitem>Travel Bug</em>
  <li>one random <em class=gameitem>Event</em> card
</ul>     

<p>
The Tracking Panel is used to keep track of your Cacher Character, Points coins,
Equipment cards, and Travel Bugs during the game.  The Cacher token is used to 
mark your position on the map board.  The colored pegs are used on the 
<em class=gameitem>Active Caches Panel</em> (on the right side of the map) to
mark the caches that you have found.  You may look at your Event card at any time,
but don't show it to the other players yet.
  
<p>
Each Cacher Character starts with a particular item (usually an Equipment card).
Find that card, and place it on your <em class=gameitem>Tracking Panel</em>.
For example, if you drew <em class=cacher>Birder&nbsp;Brandon</em>, you start with
the <em class=equipment>Binoculars</em> Equipment card.  
Most Cacher Characters also have unique advantages and disadvantages.  For 
example, <em class=cacher>Collector&nbsp;Colin</em> may carry any number of Travel
Bugs.  Don't forget to apply these special rules during the game.
Once everyone has found his or her starting equipment, you may shuffle the 
remaining Equipment cards, and place the deck nearby.

<img src="images/rules/LatLonArrows.jpg" align=right>

<h3>STARTING LOCATION</h3>

After all caches have been placed, roll the <em class=gameitem>Alphabet die</em>
to determine your starting location.  Each Cacher Token starts on one of the
<em class=gameitem>Latitude/Longitude Arrows</em> around the map frame.  There
are 4 arrows for each letter (one on each side of the map); you may start on any
of these four arrows not already occupied by another player's token.

<h2>PLAYING THE GAME</h2>

<h3>TURN SEQUENCE</h3>

A <em class=concept>turn</em> refers to a single player.  A <em class=concept>
round</em> refers to one turn for all players (it still counts as a round, even
if some players had to skip their turn).

<p>
Each turn has two parts: (1) events, and (2) moving/searching.  At the beginning
of your turn, you may choose to play an Event card.  If you do not, then another
player may play on Event card on you -- the option passes to the player whose 
turn is next.  Only one event may be played per turn.  If an event is played,
follow the instructions on the Event card.  In some cases, this may cause you to
end your turn before you get a chance to roll.

<p>
Each turn, you declare whether you are going to Move, or Search.  You may only
Search if your token is located in the same tile as a Cache you have not yet 
found.  You roll both 6-sided dice to Move or Search and add the numbers 
together to determine how far you can move (or how well you searched).

<p>
<em class=tbd>TBD-pictures</em><br>
The dice are different.  Both have sides with pips like normal dice, representing
the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Various combinations are possible, so that you can
roll a total between 0 and 7; the average is 3.  The color of each numbered side
is either yellow or blue.  The colors matter if you roll doubles, or for certain
bonuses.  Rolling doubles triggers an event; see the <em class=section>EVENTS
</em> section below for more information.  Each die also has one special (red or
green) side with a cache icon, which is discussed in the <em class=section>
SEARCHING</em> and <em class=section>New Cache Event</em> sections below.

<h3>MOVING</h3>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 border=1>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/rules/Moving.jpg"></td>
<td>
<em class=section>Normal Movement</em><br>
When moving, you may move your token up to the total number you rolled on both 
dice (plus any bonuses you may get).  This can be from 0 to 7 tiles (or more 
with bonuses). You don't have to move the full amount.   Each step of your move
must be to an adjacent tile; you may not move diagonally.  The <em class=find>
FIND</em> and <em class=dnf>DNF</em> sides count as zero.
</td></tr>

<tr class=advanced>
<td><img src="images/rules/MovePathBonus.jpg"></td>
<td>
<em class=section>Paths</em><br>
If you end your turn on a tile containing a Path, you may move one extra tile
<em>along that Path</em>.  This can be a significant advantage, so you should
try to stay on a Path as long as possible before heading to the cache.  All 
Urban tiles count as Paths.
</td></tr>

<tr class=advanced>
<td><img src="images/rules/MoveStreamCrossing.jpg"></td>
<td>
<em class=section>Streams</em><br>
Unlike Paths, Streams occur at the edge between tiles.  Streams may be crossed,
but they must be crossed carefully.  You may only cross a Stream if your Move
roll (not counting any bonuses) is 3 or less.  If you roll 4 or higher, you can 
still move your token if you like, but you can't cross the Stream.  Whenever you
cross a Stream, you must end your turn, even if you have extra moves remaining.  
These rules do not apply if you cross the Stream using one of the bridges.
</td></tr>

</table>

<h4>Movement Bonuses</h4>

Some Cacher Characters and Equipment cards gives you a bonus (or penalty) to move.
For example, if you have the <em class=equipment>Binoculars</em>, you may move an 
extra tile if you rolled a 4 or higher.  In some cases, this bonus requires a 
certain type of terrain.  These bonuses work the same way the Path bonus does.  
For example, the <em class=equipment>Hiking&nbsp;Boots</em> give you a +1 when you 
are moving in Forest terrain.  If you finish your move on that type of 
terrain, then you may move one additional tile as long as you will still be in a
Forest tile.

<p>
You still get to use your bonuses even if you roll a zero.  So, if you're on a
tile with a Path, you can move at least one tile (if you stay on the Path).
You may use more than one movement bonus per turn.  So, if you happen to have the
<em class=equipment>Hiking&nbsp;Boots</em> and the <em class=equipment>Binoculars</em>,
you can combine them to get +2 on a single turn.  This includes the Path bonus 
too; so you would get +2 when using the <em class=equipment>Hiking&nbsp;Boots</em>
on a Forest tile with a Path.
	
<h4>Jumping</h4>

Some equipment (such as the <em class=equipment>FRS&nbsp;Radio</em>) and events (such
as <em class=event>Broken&nbsp;Wrist</em> and <em class=event>Meet&nbsp;and&nbsp;Greet</em>)
allow you to <em class=concept>jump</em> to other locations.  This simply means that 
you move your token to another location, ignoring any movement bonuses, 
penalties, or other terrain effects (such as Stream crossing restrictions).  

<h3>SEARCHING</h3>

Each cache has a <em class=concept>Difficulty Rating</em> -- from 1 (the easiest)
to 5 (the hardest).  In order to find the cache, you must roll equal to or higher
than the Difficulty Rating.  Some Cacher Characters and Equipment cards gives you
a bonus (or penalty) to search.  For example, if you have the <em class=equipment>
Flashlight</em>, you add 1 to your Search roll when searching for any Micro cache.

<p>
<img src="images/rules/CacheDice.png" align=left hspace=10>

One die has a special <em class=find>FIND</em> side.  If you roll this, you 
automatically find any cache you are searching for.  The other die has a special
<em class=dnf>DNF</em> (<i>did not find</i>) side.  If you roll the DNF, you fail to 
find the cache (no matter what your rolled on the other die).  You must wait 
until your next turn to try again.  Otherwise, apply any bonuses or penalties 
to determine your Search score.  If your Search score is equal to or higher than
the cache Difficulty Rating, you find the cache!  

<p>
Geocachers often team up to find caches.  Any time two or more cachers are both 
on the same tile, they all get credit for the find if any one of them finds the
cache.  Only the player who makes the successful Search roll gets the 
<em class=ftf>FTF</em> bonus point, and draws more than one Equipment card
(see the <em class=section>First To Find </em> section).  The other players don't
roll on their turn, they just collect their Point coins and Equipment card.

<h3>FINDING A CACHE</h3>

When you find a cache:

<ul>
 <li>get a Point Coin equal to the Difficulty Rating of the cache
 <li>put one of your colored pegs into the Active Caches Panel to show you found this cache
 <li>draw an Equipment card
 <li>take and/or leave Travel Bugs (see the <em class=section>Travel Bug</em> section)
</ul>

<div class = advanced>
<img src="images/rules/PointCoin-3.gif" align=left hspace=10>

Finding a cache is the main way to earn points in the game.  You score points 
equal to the cache Difficulty Rating (add the appropriate coin to your pile of
Point coins on your <em class=gameitem>Tracking Panel</em>).  If you were the 
last player to find a cache (in other words, all players have now found it), you
remove it from the board, and from the <em class=gameitem>Active Caches Panel</em>.
This makes room for another cache that might be added later.  Otherwise, put one
of your colored pegs into the proper cache slot on the <em class=gameitem>Active
Caches Panel</em>.  This allows everyone to keep track of which players have 
found which caches.

<h4>First To Find (FTF)</h4>

<img src="images/rules/FTF.gif" align=left hspace=10>

If you were the first player to find the cache, you get
a bonus.  Take the <em class=ftf>FTF</em> coin from the appropriate slot on the 
<em class=gameitem>Active Caches Panel</em>, and add it to your pile of point 
coins; it's worth 1 point.  Instead of drawing a single Equipment card, you may
get to draw multiple cards (equal to the cache Difficulty Rating).  Look at them
and choose the one you want to keep, and shuffle the others back into the deck.
For example, if you are the first to find a cache with Difficulty Rating of 3,
you would draw three Equipment cards, and choose the one you want to keep.
</div>
	
<h2>GEOCACHES</h2>

Specific caches are represented by the <em class=gameitem>Cache Labels</em> on 
the <em class=gameitem>Active Caches Panel</em>, and by a Cache Box token on the
map.  Each cache has a name <em class=tbd>(most are named after actual geocaches)
</em>, a type (Traditional, Micro, Multi, or Puzzle), and a Difficulty Rating 
(from 1 to 5).  A few are hybrids, such as a multi-stage puzzle cache.  Some
caches have special rules that are noted on the Cache Label, and may be described
in more detail in the <em class=section>Clarifications</em> section below.

<h3>MICRO CACHES</h3>

Micro caches are just like normal caches, except they are too small to contain 
items for trading.  So, when you find a Micro cache, you don't get to draw any
Equipment cards, and you can't leave any Travel Bugs in the cache.

<div class=advanced>

<img src="images/rules/Cache-TubeTorcher.png" align=right hspace=10>

<h3>MULTI-CACHES</h3>

Multiple-stage caches (multi-cache for short) require you to find one or more
<em class=concept>stages</em>, before you can find the actual cache.  In
geocaching, each stage usually contains a clue or the coordinates that lead to
the next stage.  These caches are typically more challenging than normal 
single-stage caches.  In GPS Quest, you must make a separate Search roll for
each stage.  The number of stages is specified on the cache label.  For example,
<em class=geocache> Tube Torcher</em> is a famous 3-stage multi-cache with a 
Difficulty Rating of 5.  To find it, you would have to make 3 successful Search
rolls.

<p>
<b>Each time you successfully find a stage, you may continue rolling to 
try and find the next stage.</b>  So it is possible to find a multi-cache in a
single turn, although it's unlikely (especially for those level 4 or higher).
You only have to find each stage once (keep count each time you make a successful
Search roll); you don't have to start over each turn.  If more than one cacher is
on the same spot, each successful Search roll counts for everyone on the team.
Note that each roll you make may trigger an event, but only one event can be 
played per turn (so you may end up ignoring some triggers).

</div>

<h3>PUZZLE CACHES</h3>

Unlike Traditional caches, puzzle caches require that you solve a puzzle in
order to get the coordinates to the cache.  In GPS Quest, we use the row and
column letters (of the tile where the cache is hidden) as part of the puzzle.
Before a player can Search for the cache, he or she must <em class=concept>
solve the puzzle</em> by supplying a name that contains those two letters and
fits the Category (listed on the puzzle cache label).  The letters can appear 
anywhere in the solution, in any order.  The puzzle can only be solved when 
the player's token is at the cache location.

<p>
For example, let's say you have placed the <em class=geocache>Primal Instinct</em>
cache at row <em class=coord>U</em> and column <em class=coord>Z</em>.
The category of this puzzle cache is <em class=concept>Animals</em>.  You could
solve this puzzle using the word "buzzard".  Another player could also solve it
using a different animal such as "zebra mussel" (multi-word names are acceptable).
Some categories allow proper names as well.  If you have access to field guides 
or other sources of names, we encourage you to use them.  That's not cheating,
it's research!  If it's not clear whether a player's proposed solution fits the
category, the other players should vote.

<p>
Once a solution has been used, it cannot be used again by any player for any 
puzzle cache during the current game.  Once you've solved the puzzle, treat it 
just like a regular cache.  You still need to make a successful Search roll in
order to find it.  If you fail to find it with your first Search roll, that's 
okay.  You don't need to solve the puzzle again; just continue to search as you
would for any other cache.

<h3>HYBRID CACHES</h3>

It is possible to have caches that are more than one type.  For example, the 
infamous <em class=geocache>Blood and Guts</em> cache is a 5-stage multi-cache,
and also a puzzle cache.  These caches are treated as both types for events that
affect caches of a certain type.

<h2>EQUIPMENT</h2>

Various types of geocaching gear are represented in the game using the deck of 
Equipment cards.  Although you don't need any special equipment to geocache 
(other than a GPS), some of it can be quite helpful.  Sometimes the equipment
will have a built-in bonus, such as the <em class=equipment>Flashlight</em>, 
which helps you when searching.

<img src="images/BugSpray.jpg" align=right>

<p>
Other Equipment cards can prevent the effects of certain events.  For example, 
the <em class=equipment>Insect&nbsp;Repellent</em> can prevent the 
<em class=event>Mosquitoes</em> or <em class=event>Ticks</em>
from bothering you.  Most of the time you just need to have the Equipment card 
on your Tracking Panel to benefit from it.  Sometimes, you must discard the card
in order to use it.  For example, the <em class=equipment>First-aid&nbsp;Kit</em> can
be discarded to prevent most injury events in the game.

<img src="images/rules/Backpack.jpg" align=left>

<p>
You may have up to 4 Equipment cards (played face up on your Tracking Panel).
If you already have all the Equipment cards that you are allowed when you draw
a new one, you must either discard it or one of your other Equipment cards. 
Some Equipment cards (such as the <em class=equipment>Backpack</em>) 
allow you to have more than 4 Equipment cards in play.

<p>
Unlike Event cards, <b>when an Equipment card is discarded, shuffle it back into 
the deck</b>.

<div class=advanced>

<h3>Equipment Combos</h3>

At the bottom of each Equipment card, there is a <em class=concept>Combo</em>
name.  For example, the <em class=equipment>Binoculars</em> and 
<em class=equipment>Field&nbsp;Guide</em> cards comprise the 
<em class=combo>Bird&nbsp;Watcher</em> Combo.  Each Combo is made up of two 
Equipment cards.  If you're lucky enough to get both cards in a particular Combo,
you get a special bonus (shown below).

<p>
Some of these special effects (such as the <em class=combo>Bird&nbsp;Watcher</em>
Combo) are triggered when a particular roll is made.  Only rolls that count have
a chance of triggering Combo bonuses.  When a game effect (such as
<em class=cacher>Determined&nbsp;Dan</em>) allows a player to re-roll the dice, the
first roll is ignored.  However if a player takes another turn, each of those
rolls count, and therefore each roll has a chance of triggering a Combo bonus.
Similarly, when a player makes multiple rolls while searching for a Multi-cache,
each of those rolls has a chance to trigger events or combo effects.
   
</div>

<h2>EVENTS</h2>

<img src="images/rules/EventRoll.png" align=left hspace=10>

Whenever you roll to Move or Search, you roll the two 6-sided dice.  If you roll 
doubles (the same number on both dice), you draw an Event card (before moving or
searching).  The colors on the dice determine when the event takes place.  If 
the colors match (both blue or both yellow), then you may keep that Event card,
and play it on yourself or another player later in the game (not on this turn).
If the colors differ, then you must reveal the Event card (unless the card says
otherwise), and follow the instructions on it.

<p>
You may hold up to 3 Event cards.  If you are already holding 3 Event cards, you
may keep the new one if you like, but you must discard one of your old ones.  
Keep these cards face-down, so the other players don't know what events you have.

<p>
You may play an Event card on any player (including yourself) at the beginning
of that player's turn (before the dice are rolled).  <b>Only 1 Event card may be
played per turn.</b>  The current player always gets the chance to play an Event
card on himself (if he has one), before another player may do so.  If more than
one player wants to play an Event card, the player whose turn comes next gets to
play it.  If the current player rolls doubles after someone has already played
an Event card this turn, he keeps the new Event card (whether or not the dice 
colors matched).

<p>
Unlike Equipment cards, <b>when an Event card is played, remove it from the 
game</b> (unless the card says otherwise).  Most events are resolved when they
are played, and only affect the current player.  In some cases, an event may 
affect more that one player, or may last one or more rounds.  See the
<em class=section>Clarifications</em> section for how to handle these events.

<h4>New Cache Event</h4>

<img src="images/rules/CacheDice.png" align=left hspace=10>

If you roll both Cache icons (the <em class=find>FIND</em> and <em class=dnf>DNF</em>
sides), you have triggered a New Cache Event.  Your turn is over (you don't move, 
or find any cache you may have been searching for), but you get to add a new cache
onto the board, and you earn 2 points!  Randomly select a cache label to place.  
See the rules below for how to select a board location.   If the cache is not a
Micro cache, you also randomly select a Travel Bug label to place in the cache.  

<p>
No more than 12 caches may be on the board at one time.  If you roll the New Cache
Event when all 12 cache slots on the <em class=gameitem>Active Caches Panel</em>
are full, you don't get to place a new one (and you don't get the 2 bonus points).
Instead, you draw a new Travel Bug, and place it on any of the caches which don't
already contain one.  You get 1 bonus point for placing the Travel Bug.  Note that
the <em class=event>Hide&nbsp;a&nbsp;Cache</em> Event card is different; it allows
you to remove a cache if there are already 12 on the board. 

<h4>Random Cache Placement</h4>

<img src="images/rules/AlphabetDie.jpg" align=right>

During the game, you may get to add additional caches onto the board.  These 
should be placed randomly.  You can choose a random location by rolling the 
<em class=gameitem>Alphabet die</em> twice (once to determine the latitude/row,
and once to determine the longitude/column).  The rows and columns are marked 
with the letters of the alphabet.  For example, if you roll "S" and "V", place
the cache token in row <em class=coord>S</em>, column <em class=coord>V</em>.
Two caches cannot be on the same tile; roll again if necessary to avoid that.

<p>
The <em class=gameitem>Alphabet die</em> has all 26 letters of the alphabet, as
well as 4 <em class=concept>wilds</em>.  If you roll one of the wilds, you can
choose any letter you like.  If you roll a wild for your column (for example),
you may choose any tile along the row you rolled.  If you roll wild on your
first roll, you may roll for the column before choosing which row you want.

</div>

<h3>TRAVEL BUGS</h3>

Travel Bugs (TBs) are represented in GPS Quest using small labels.  Players can
acquire TBs by finding a cache that contains them.  If the cache you found 
contains any TBs, you may take one.  If you do, move the TB label from the
Active Caches Panel onto your Tracking Panel.  You may only take one TB, and
only if you don't already have two.

<p>
If you have any TBs with you when you end your turn on a tile that contains a 
cache that you have found, you may leave them in that cache.  To do so, move the
TB label from your Tracking Panel onto the proper cache slot of the Active Caches
Panel.  You can leave any number of TBs in the cache; you gain 1 point for each 
one you leave.  You can't leave a TB in the same cache that you got it from, or
in any Micro cache.

<img src="images/rules/TravelBug.jpg" align=right>

<p>
Each TB has a goal (shown on the TB label).  If you help a TB reach its goal, 
then you score 3 points (instead of the 1 point you normally get).  For example,
you can take the <em class=tb>Swimmer</em> TB (shown on the right) to any 
cache which is next to a Stream to achieve its goal.  You may want to re-visit
a cache which you have previously found in order to leave a TB.  That's fine -
you don't have to search for the cache again once you've found it; just end your
turn on the tile containing that cache.

<p>
Sometimes a TB might start out in a cache that would satisfy its goal;
if that happens, you must find another cache in order to earn the 3 points.
When a TB reaches its goal, it is removed from the game.  In some cases, 
it may not be possible for a TB to reach its goal; but you can still score
1 point by leaving it in a cache.

<center><h2>CLARIFICATIONS</h2></center>	

<h4>Caches</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=geocache>Project APE</em>: This cache is big.  Really big.  This 
makes it pretty easy to find, and it also holds a lot of trinkets.  So, when 
you find this cache, you get to draw four Equipment cards to choose
from, even if you're not the FTF.  (You still only get to keep one though!)

<li><em class=geocache>North, To Alaska!</em>: This is a <em class=concept>
moving</em> cache.  After you find this cache, you get to move it.  See the 
<em class=section>Random Cache Placement</em> section for instructions on how to
determine a new location.

</ul>

<h4>Cache Characters</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=cacher>Jolly&nbsp;Jamie</em>, <em class=cacher>Kindly&nbsp;Kathy</em>:
The <em class=equipment>Geocoin</em> Equipment cards do count towards a 
player's total points, but the <em class=equipment>CITO&nbsp;Bag</em> does not.

<li><em class=cacher>Independent&nbsp;Isabel</em>: A map <em class=concept>quadrant
</em> is the separate board piece that represents a quarter of the total map area.

<li><em class=cacher>Puzzler&nbsp;Paul</em>: Paul may roll for a new letter at
the end of his turn, if his token is at the cache.  On his next turn, he may use
that letter to solve the puzzle instead of one of the regular puzzle letters.
He may roll for a new letter once each turn, but he must use at least one of the
regular puzzle letters in his solution. 

</ul>

<h4>Equipment and Combos</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=equipment>Cell&nbsp;Phone</em>: You may choose to take the +1 
bonus after you roll.

<li><em class=equipment>First-aid&nbsp;Kit</em>: Injury Event cards include 
<em class=event>Blisters</em>, 
<em class=event>Broken&nbsp;Wrist</em>, and
<em class=event>Twisted&nbsp;Ankle</em>.

<li><em class=combo>Insulation</em>: For example, if someone plays the
<em class=event>Litterbug</em> event card on you, you would only lose 1 point
instead of 4.
 
<li><em class=combo>Karma</em>: If the event is discarded, other events may still
be played on you this turn.

<li><em class=combo>Naturalist</em>: Wildlife Event cards include 
<em class=event>13-Year&nbsp;Cicadas</em>, 
<em class=event>Bear&nbsp;Encounter</em>, 
<em class=event>Fire&nbsp;Ants</em>, 
<em class=event>Fox&nbsp;Hunt</em>, 
<em class=event>Ivory-billed&nbsp;Woodpecker</em>, 
<em class=event>Killer&nbsp;Bees</em>, 
<em class=event>Mosquitoes</em>, 
<em class=event>Ticks</em>, and
<em class=event>What&nbsp;Kind&nbsp;of&nbsp;Snake&nbsp;Is&nbsp;That?</em>.

</ul>

<h4>Caches and Travel Bugs</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=tb>Grover</em>: Any Forest tile that is not adjacent to another
Forest tile counts as a grove.

</ul> 

<h4>Events</h4>

<ul>

<li><em class=event>13-Year&nbsp;Cicadas</em>: This event lasts two rounds.  In
other words, it affects all players for their next two turns.  Place this card on
the Active Caches Panel, so all players can see it.  Remove it from the game after
it has been in effect for two rounds.  Although only one Event card may be played
per turn, other events may be played while a multi-turn event is in effect.
Other Event cards that last a round or more include:
<em class=event>Drought</em>, 
<em class=event>Equipment&nbsp;Rental</em>, 
<em class=event>Fresh&nbsp;Snow</em>, and 
<em class=event>Solar&nbsp;Flares</em>.

<li><em class=event>Bug&nbsp;Swap</em>: If no one else has a Travel Bug, ignore this
event.

<li><em class=event>Cache&nbsp;Pirates</em>: Any Travel Bug in the cache is removed
from the game.

<li><em class=event>Equipment&nbsp;Rental</em>: If you lose the equipment you rented, 
you lose 5 points.  Renting the <em class=equipment>Duct&nbsp;Tape</em> to prevent an
event would not be a good idea, since you can't return it once you've discarded 
it.  Rented equipment cannot be borrowed or traded.

<li><em class=event>Eureka!</em>: If you're having trouble solving a particular
puzzle cache, you may play this card instead.  Or you can play it to find a hard
cache.  It only replaces as a single Search roll though, so you would still have
to roll for the other stages of a Multi-cache.  Like all Event cards, you must
play this card before you roll.

<li><em class=event>Meet&nbsp;and&nbsp;Greet</em>: This is known as an Event Cache
in geocaching.  Roll the <em class=gameitem>Alphabet&nbsp;die</em> twice to 
determine the location of the party.

<li><em class=event>Lost&nbsp;and&nbsp;Found</em>: If the player you give the card to
doesn't have room, that player must discard a card (they may discard the one
you gave them).

<li><em class=event>May&nbsp;I&nbsp;Borrow&nbsp;That?</em>: You can only borrow a 
<em class=concept>pack</em> Equipment card (such as the <em class=equipment>
Backpack</em>, <em class=equipment>Belt&nbsp;Pack</em>, <em class=equipment>
Hydration&nbsp;Pack</em>, <em class=equipment>Photographer's&nbsp;Vest</em>,
<em class=equipment>Swag&nbsp;Bag</em> or <em class=equipment>
Waterproof&nbsp;Jacket</em>) if doing so would not cause that player to have 
more Equipment cards than he's allowed to hold.  You can't borrow rented equipment.

<li><em class=event>Hide&nbsp;a&nbsp;Cache</em>: This card works just like 
rolling the <em class=section>New Cache Event</em>, with one important difference.
If there are already 12 caches on the board, this card allows you to remove any 
cache that you have found -- even if other cachers have not found it yet.  
However, you may not remove a cache in the same tile as another player's token.

<li><em class=event>Shortcut</em>: Allows you to move up to 6 tiles even if you
cross a stream.

<li><em class=event>Upgrade</em>: If there is more than one player with the 
fewest Equipment cards, you may choose the player.  See the <em class=event>
Lost&nbsp;and&nbsp;Found</em> clarification above. 

<li><em class=event>Weather&nbsp;Forecast</em>: Weather Event cards (also used
 by the <em class=combo>Weatherman</em>Combo) include
<em class=event>Bad&nbsp;Weather</em>,  
<em class=event>Caught&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Rain</em>, 
<em class=event>Cold&nbsp;Snap</em>, 
<em class=event>Drought</em>, 
<em class=event>Early&nbsp;Frost</em>, 
<em class=event>Flash&nbsp;Flood</em>,
<em class=event>Fresh&nbsp;Snow</em>, and
<em class=event>It's&nbsp;a&nbsp;Dry&nbsp;Heat</em>.
